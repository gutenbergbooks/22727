grown stronger and stronger as the years have rolled by. Fortunate
is the man who wins for himself two such friends! I have never
ceased to remember the warm interest you and your noble-hearted
wife took from the first in my explorations in Africa. I can only
give you in return love and devotion for all the kindness I have
experienced at your hands.</i></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Young Folks:</span></p>

<p>Friend Paul has led many of you into the great
Equatorial Forest of Africa. We met there many
strange and wild tribes of men, and lived among cannibals
and dwarfs or pygmies. We hunted together,
and killed many elephants, fierce gorillas, leopards,
huge crocodiles, hippopotami, buffalos, antelopes,
strange-looking monkeys, wonderful chimpanzees of
different varieties,&mdash;some of them white, others yellow
or black,&mdash;and many other kinds of animals.</p>


<p>In this book I am going to take you to a very different
part of the world. I am going to lead you
towards the far North, to "The Land of the Long
Night,"&mdash;a land where during a part of the year the
sun is not seen, for it does not rise above the horizon,
and in some parts of the country does not show itself
for sixty-seven days, during which time the moon,
stars, and the aurora borealis take its place.</p>

<p>"The Land of the Long Night" is a land of darkness,
of snow, of wind, and at times of intense cold;
and we shall have a long journey before us, and shall
have to change horses and vehicles at many post
stations, and at those places we shall get meals and
lodgings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>When once in "The Land of the Long Night,"
we shall roam far and wide&mdash;east, west, north&mdash;over
a vast trackless region, covered with deep snow, drawn
by reindeer instead of horses, and sometimes we shall
walk or run with skees, which are the snowshoes of
that country, and very unlike those used by our
Indians.</p>

<p>We shall sleep on the snow in bags made of reindeer
skins, follow the nomadic Laplander and his
reindeer, live with him and sleep in his <i>k&aring;ta</i> or tent.
We shall hunt wolves, bears, and different kinds of
foxes and other animals, and sail and fish on the
stormy Arctic seas.</p>

<p>We shall have plenty of fun, in spite of the snow,
the terrific wind, and the cold we shall encounter; and,
thanks to the houses of refuge which we shall find in
our times of peril, we shall not perish in these Arctic
regions. But woe to the man who wanders in that
far northern land without a guide or without knowing
where these houses or farms of refuge are to be found,
for he will surely succumb in some one of the storms
that are certain to overtake him.</p>

<p>We shall cross the Swedish and Norwegian mountains
of the far North, which rise to a height of several
thousand feet, and come to the desolate shores of the
Arctic Ocean, and there live among the people.</p>

<p>In a sunny room at the Marlborough in Broadway
I have written this book. It is a dear little room,
made bright at night with electric lights, and full of
delightful reminiscences of cheerful evenings with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
friends, all kinds of knick-knacks, tin horns, "booby"
prizes, mugs, etc.,&mdash;souvenirs of frolics at which I
have had fine times. My two windows look out on
the roof of a church; it is all I can see; the noise
of a wheel never reaches my ears. It is an ideal
room to write books in.</p>

<p>I am surrounded by pictures of boys and girls, and
many older friends; they look down upon me and
cheer me, and when I write they all seem to say,
"Go on, Paul," and at other times, they cry, "Stop,
Paul, you have written enough to-day; go and take
a walk, go and see people and life, dine with friends;
you will work much better to-morrow. 'All work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy.' We shall be here
to welcome you when you come back."</p>

<p>How good it is to have friends, no matter how
humble some of them are. I love them all. No
one ever has too many friends, and life without them
is not worth having.</p>

<p>Now, as I am ready to lay down my pen, I draw a
long breath&mdash;"The Land of the Long Night" is
ready for the printer. I am just thinking: all my
books have been published in New York, and all but
two have been written, in the dear old city.</p>

<h1>The<br />
Land of the Long Night</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>On the Way to "The Land of the Long Night."&mdash;Homesick.&mdash;Tempted
to Return.&mdash;Girls and Boys say "No;
Go on, Go on, Paul."&mdash;Decide to Continue my Journey.&mdash;Winter
Coming On.&mdash;Don Warmer Clothing.&mdash;From
Stockholm North.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AT the time when this narrative begins I was
travelling on the highroad that skirts the
southern coast of Sweden, then turns northward and
follows the shores of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of
Bothnia. I had reached that part of the highway
overlooking the narrow part of the Sound which separates
Sweden from Denmark, and had just left the
pretty little city of Helsingborg, and was looking at
the hundreds of vessels and steamers which were
moving towards the Baltic or coming out of that
sea. It was a most beautiful sight.</p>

<p>I intended to follow the road as far north as it
went, and enter "The Land of the Long Night" when
the sun was below the horizon for many weeks. I
had plenty of time to spare, for it was the beginning
of October.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>On that day my horse was trotting at the usual gait
of post-horses, going at the rate of six or seven miles
an hour. He knew every stone, ditch, bridge, and
house on the road, for many and many a time the
dear old animal had made this journey to and fro,
often twice each way in a day. He had been a post-horse
for over twelve years.</p>

<p>His master, my driver, was very kind to him. He
always alighted when there was a hill to ascend, and
walked by his side, gently urging him to go on.
When the top of the hill was reached, he stopped to
give the animal time to take breath; then, before
starting again, he would give him a piece or two
of black bread, sometimes a potato, which he had put
in his pocket before leaving. The people of Scandinavia
are always kind to their dumb animals. Believe
me, dear young folks, there is something mean
and cowardly about a man who is not kind to dumb
creatures. Do not have him for a friend!</p>

<p>As I looked at the ships sailing from the Baltic, a
sudden yearning to go home took hold of me, and I
forgot all about "The Land of the Long Night." I
thought of all my dear friends, of all the school girls
and boys whom I knew, and I wanted to see them
ever so much, even if it might be only for a day. It
would have made me so happy to look upon their faces
once more. Sometimes one feels very lonely when
away from home, and that day I could not help it. I
thought of dear Jeannie, of sweet Gertrude, and
Hilda, of Marie, of Pauline, of Helen, of Laura, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Blanche, of Julia, of Melissa, of Rowena, of Beatrice,
of Alice, of Maude, of Ethel, of Evelyn, of Louise, of
Iphigenia, and others that were also dear to me. Then
I thought of Charles, of Arthur, of William, of Louis,
of John, of Robert, of Frank, of George, of Anson,
of Mortimer, of Eddy, of Fred, and of many others.</p>

<p>Many of the girls and boys call me either "Paul,"
"Friend Paul," or "Uncle Paul;" some of the girls
call me "Cousin Paul." These are my chums, and
it is lovely to have chums! I thought of the fun and
good times I had had with all of them; and I felt on
that day that I loved them more than ever as the
great ocean separated us.</p>

<p>I thought of all the young folks whom I had talked
to in the public or private schools in many of the
States,&mdash;for if there is a thing Friend Paul likes, it is
to talk to the young folks at school. As I thought
of this, it seemed as if I could see them listening
to me.</p>

<p>I suddenly became very homesick. I said to myself:
"I will go to America and see my dear friends,
and then return to go to 'The Land of the Long
Night.'" I could cross the Sound, go to Copenhagen,&mdash;the
city was almost in sight, and a nice city it is,&mdash;and
take one of the comfortable steamers of the Thingvalla
Line, now called Scandinavian-American Line,
for New York.</p>

<p>As I was thinking of this, it suddenly seemed to
me that I heard voices coming across the Atlantic,&mdash;voices
from friends, from school girls and boys, calling:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
"Friend Paul, go on, go on to 'The Land of the
Long Night' first, and then come and tell us how it is
there. Be of good cheer; no harm will befall you;
you will be all right."</p>

<p>Friend Paul cheered up when in imagination he
had heard the voices of his young friends urging him
to go on, and he answered back: "Girls and boys,
you are right. I am going to 'The Land of the
Long Night' first, and on my return I will tell you all
that I have seen there."</p>

<p>The dear old horse did not know what I was thinking,
and was trotting along&mdash;until suddenly he made
a sharp turn and entered the post station, the end of
his journey. There I changed horse and vehicle,
took some refreshment, and started again. During
the afternoon, I came to the town of Landskrona.
There, looking towards the Sound, I saw a steamer
of the Thingvalla Line gliding over the sea on its way
to New York, and I said aloud, "Steamer, you are
not going to take me home this time. I am going to
'The Land of the Long Night' first, to the land of
snow and of gales, the land of the bear, of the wolf, of
the fox, and of the ermine. Good-bye, good-bye, dear
steamer! I hope you will have a successful passage,
and also that you have on board many Scandinavians
going to our shores to make their home with us."</p>

<p>I thought I again heard the same voices as before
cry in response, "Good for you, Paul, good for you!"</p>

<p>I felt now that I was a different man. It was as
if I had actually heard the voices of the dear young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
people encouraging me to go forward. I suddenly
became very restless and full of energy. I wanted
my horse to go faster. The young folks wished me
to go to "The Land of the Long Night." To that
country I should go.</p>

<p>From that day I was ready for any amount of hardships,
of bumping and knocking about in sleighs. I
did not care if my ears and nose were frozen. All
I wanted was to go ahead as fast as I could until I
reached "The Land of the Long Night."</p>

<p>I was in splendid condition for the journey. I had
been roughing it all summer in the mountain fastnesses
of Norway. I had been living on cream,
butter, cheese, and milk, and had had bacon twice a
week, on Sundays and Wednesdays.</p>

<p>There were about one hundred and forty or fifty
post stations before I reached Haparanda, the most
northern town on the Gulf of Bothnia.</p>

<p>Every day's travel brought me nearer to "The
Land of the Long Night," but it was still a very long
way off. I had yet to sleep at many post stations and
to change horses and vehicles many times.</p>

<p>I entered and left many towns&mdash;Malm&ouml;, Skan&ouml;r,
Falsterb&ouml;, Trelleborg,&mdash;these last three were quaint,
and the most southern towns in Sweden. How
charming, clean, and neat are those little Swedish
towns! I wished I could have tarried in some of
them. Then I made a sweep eastward, following the
coast, and passed the town of Ystad, and then I gradually
drove northward, for now the road skirted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
shores of the Baltic. I passed Cimbrishamn, S&ouml;lvesberg,
Carlshamn, and Carlskrona.</p>

<p>From Carlskrona the country was very pretty, and
on my way to Kalmar, and further north, I could see
the Island of &Ouml;land with its numerous windmills.</p>

<p>The continuous driving, often in vehicles without
springs, was rather hard on my trousers, and I had not
many pairs with me. In a word my outfit was very
modest. To travel comfortably, one must have as
little baggage as possible; for if you have too much
baggage it is as if you were dragging a heavy log behind
you; you are not your own master, all kinds of
difficulties come in the way, and you have become the
slave of your own baggage. I bought clothing as I
went along. I wished I could have found some
trousers lined with leather, like those used by cavalry
soldiers and by men who ride much on horseback;
these would have lasted a long time.</p>

<p>The weather was getting colder every day, winter
was coming, and we had had a few falls of snow. I
passed Oscarshamn and Westervik, and at last about the
middle of November I arrived in Stockholm. But I
had yet to travel more than nine hundred miles to the
north before I came to the southern border of "The
Land of the Long Night."</p>

<p>I had to give up my New York overcoat for warmer
clothing and get a new winter outfit. I bought a long,
loose overcoat coming down to my feet. It was lined
throughout with thick, hairy wolf skin, which is said
by the people of the far North to be the warmest lining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
after the skin of the reindeer. I also purchased
big top-boots lined inside with furry wolf skin, and a
round beaver cap with a border which, when turned
down, protected my ears and came to my eyes. I had
besides a big, heavy hood, lined with fur, to be used
when it was very cold. I had a pair of leather mittens
lined inside with fur (mittens keep one's hands much
warmer than gloves, because they are not so tight and
they do not impede the circulation of the blood).
The collar of my coat rose above my head and almost
hid my face, and when I wore my hood only my eyes
could be seen. In this winter costume I could drive
all day long without feeling cold.</p>

<p>From Stockholm I drove to Upsala by road&mdash;for I
did not care for railway travelling&mdash;changing horse
and vehicle at every post station. When I reached
Gefle winter had come on in earnest. Now all the
houses in the hamlets and towns which I passed had
double windows, and at the bottom, between the two, a
layer of cotton was spread to absorb the moisture.
Instead of sliding sashes, French windows opening
like doors are used, and one of the panes of each is
free for ventilation. The rooms were uncarpeted, just
as in summer, but rugs were spread on the floors.</p>

<p>As I drove along it was pleasant to see at the windows,
behind the panes of glass, pots filled with roses,
carnations, geraniums, and other plants, all bending in
the direction of the sun. The sun gave scarcely any
heat, yet all the plants in a room liked to look
towards the light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I was always so glad at the end of the day's travelling
to rest at a post station, to enter the "stuga," the
every-day room, where the family lives, and see the
blazing open fireplace. How nice it was to jump into
a feather bed, and sink deep and be lost in it, and
to cover myself with a quilt filled with feathers or
eider down!</p>

<p>When I found a pleasant station I would remain
there a day or two to rest, for it was hard to drive
day after day, for ten, twelve, or fifteen, and sometimes
eighteen hours. It was interesting to see the whole
family at their daily occupations; to see the women
spin, weave, or knit; to see the men make skees,
wooden shoes, etc., and the girls and boys go to school
and have fun and play together, throwing snowballs
at each other; making snow forts and defending them
against other girls and boys that came to attack them.
I wished sometimes to join in the fray, for I love fun.</p>

<p>The snow was deep, and the snow-ploughs, drawn
by three horses, were seen pretty often on the road.
The streets in the little hamlets or towns were often
blocked.</p>

<p class="cap">AFTER I left the town of Gefle the blue sky
became obscured by clouds, a few flakes of
snow began to fall, then more and more came down,
and soon they covered the old snow, that was already
of good depth.</p>

<p>I had never before had a post-horse that went so
fast, and I wondered why. The horse knew, but I
did not: a big snowstorm was coming! He was
afraid of being caught in it, and wanted to reach his
stable in time. After a while the snow fell so thick
that I could see nothing ahead. To make things worse
it began to blow hard. Then I dropped the reins and
let the horse go as he pleased. As he knew that the
snowstorm was coming, so he would know how to get
home. Suddenly he gave three or four loud neighs;
this announced his arrival. Then he turned to the
right and entered a yard. He had reached home!</p>

<p>The next morning it was still snowing; nevertheless
I started. On the road were many snow-ploughs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at work levelling the snow. These ploughs were of
triangular form, made of heavy timber braced with
crossbeams. They were generally from eight to ten
feet in width at the back, which was the broadest part,
and above fifteen feet long. They were drawn by
four horses and attended by two men.</p>

<p>The ploughs were followed by heavy rollers of
wood to pack the snow.</p>

<p>Erik, my driver, said that every farmer is obliged
to furnish horses to clear the road and level it after
a snowstorm. The number of horses he furnishes is
regulated by the size of his farm. It is very important
that the road should be kept in good order, and
the rules are strictly enforced.</p>

<p>As we travelled along the road, it was amusing to
see horses and dogs roll in the snow; they enjoyed
it! The horses that we drove would often take a nip
of the snow, and the dogs that followed us did likewise.</p>

<p>One day when I was looking at two horses rolling
in the snow near a farmhouse, I suddenly felt a great
jerk and we were pitched out headlong! Our horse
wanted to have some fun! So he fell on his side and
was about to roll over and enjoy himself, taking the
sleigh with him; but we did not see the joke. We
succeeded in putting him on his legs. The driver
gave the animal a good scolding: "Shame on you,
shame on you!" he said to him. The horse listened,
and seemed to understand him. I think he felt
ashamed.</p>

<p>As I journeyed further north the snow got deeper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and deeper every hour. Snow-ploughs were now drawn
by five horses and generally attended by three men.</p>

<p>The snowstorm still continued. It had now lasted
over four days, and with no appearance of holding up.
The wind at times blew very hard.</p>

<p>In spite of the snowstorm I continued to travel,
and had passed the towns of S&ouml;derhamn, Hudicksvall,
Sundsvall, and Hern&ouml;sand, with their streets deep in
snow. On the fifth day we had great difficulty in
getting along. In some places the ploughs had not
passed over the road since two days before, for we
were now going through a very sparsely inhabited
country. Some parts of the road were honeycombed
with holes about fifteen inches deep, made in this
way: each horse that had passed stepped in the tracks
of the one that had preceded him, and made the holes
deeper and deeper, which made walking very difficult
for the poor animals.</p>

<p>The further north I went the deeper became the
snow, and travelling became tedious. Our sleigh
tumbled on one side or the other, upsetting before we
could say "Boo!" At each effort the poor horse
made to extricate himself, we had either to get out of
the sleigh or be thrown out. The poor brute would
often sink to his neck, and sometimes almost to his
head when he got out of the snow-plough's track!
In order to make some headway and to make up for
the slowness of the horses and bad roads, I travelled
sixteen and eighteen hours a day, and when I came to
a post station I was pretty tired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The ploughs I now met were drawn by six horses
and attended by four or five men. The struggles of
the poor animals as they sank continually in the deep
soft snow and tried to extricate themselves, were
sometimes painful to behold.</p>

<p>We always had to be careful to drive in the middle
of the road, where the snow had been cleared and packed
by the snow-ploughs and the rollers. Sometimes we
could not tell where it was, for the land around was
deeply buried and the track of the snow-ploughs was
hidden by the fresh-fallen snow.</p>

<p>When my driver made a mistake and drove one
way or the other outside of the track, the first intimation
we had was that of the horse sinking suddenly,
being ourselves upset or nearly so. Then we had a
lot of trouble putting him on the track again.</p>

<p>After several of these mishaps, the driver would
say to me: "Now I am going to let the horse go by
himself. He is accustomed every year to go in deep
snow on this road and he will know the way." "You
are right," I would reply.</p>

<p>When let alone the horse would walk very slowly,
and he would hesitate each time he put either his
right or his left foot on the snow, to make sure he
was on the right track. If he thought he was on the
left of the road, it was his left foot that came down
first; if he thought he was to the right of the road, he
put his right foot down, but not until he had made
sure that he was right. If he saw that he had made a
mistake, he turned quickly to one side or the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the horse suddenly dropped one leg in the
soft snow, on the right side of the track; this unbalanced
him and&mdash;bang! he fell on his side, taking
the sleigh with him. We were pitched out, and
as we got up on our legs we found ourselves in
snow up to our necks. Only after frantic efforts did
the horse succeed in regaining his footing.</p>

<p>As I looked around and saw our situation, and that
our three heads were just above the snow, with the
horse's head looking at us, his eyes seeming to say,
"Are you not going to help me out of this?" I
gave a great shout of laughter, for the sight was so
funny that I forgot being pitched out&mdash;and I said to
the driver, "Don't we look funny, the horse included,
with only our heads and shoulders above the snow!"</p>

<p>What a job we had to extricate ourselves, put the
poor horse on the track again, and afterwards right
the sleigh. Then we found that the harness was
broken in several places, and we had to mend it the
best way we could with numb fingers. I had stopped
laughing, for there was no fun in that.</p>

<p>"At this rate of travelling," I said to the driver,
"it will take a whole day to go three or four miles.
I do not know whether our poor horse will be able to
stand it. Look at him! He looks as if he were a
smoke-stack, so much steam is rising from his body.
He may become so exhausted that he will not be able
to go further, and we shall have to abandon the sleigh."</p>

<p>"It is so," coolly replied Lars the driver, and he
remained silent afterwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt sorry for the poor horse, and reproached myself
for not having tarried at the last post station.</p>

<p>Then I said to Lars, "If the horse gives out, we
will try to build a snow house for us three. You
have some hay, and he will not starve. As for ourselves,
we will try to reach some farm and get some
food and some oats for our poor dear horse. I am
very sorry we have no skees with us."</p>

<p>There was so much snow over the land that I
thought I had come to "Snow Land." It was over
twelve feet in depth; it had been snowing for six
consecutive days and nights, and it was snowing yet.
I was now between the sixty-third and sixty-fourth
degrees of north latitude, and I had to travel on the
road nearly two hundred miles more before I came to
the southern part of "The Land of the Long Night."
The little town of Ume&aring; for which I was bound was
still far away. I said to myself, "I have to cross this
'Snow Land' before I reach 'The Land of the
Long Night.' What hard work it will be!"</p>

<p>A little further on we came to the post station&mdash;and
how glad I was to spend the night there&mdash;to
get into a feather bed. The following day the snow-ploughs
and the rollers were busy, and the centre of
the highway was made passable for some miles further
north. So bidding good-bye to the station master
and to my driver of the day before, I started with a
fine young horse and a strong young fellow for a
driver.</p>

<p>As I looked around, I could see snow, snow, deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
snow everywhere. The fences, the stone walls of
the scattered farms, and the huge boulders with
which that part of the country is covered were buried
out of sight; only the tops of the birches and of
the fir and pine trees could be seen. I had not
met such deep snow before! I had never encountered
such a continuous snowstorm! "Surely," I
said to myself again, as I looked over the country,
"this is 'Snow Land.'" I wondered how long it
would take to cross it. The snow was nearly fourteen
feet deep on a level.</p>

<p>I next came to a part of the country where thousands
of branches of pine and fir trees had been planted
in two rows to show the line of the road. I could
not tell now when I was travelling over a river, a lake,
on land, or over the frozen Gulf of Bothnia!</p>

<p>As we were passing over one of the barren districts,
a swamp in summer, full of stones and boulders,
without a house in sight, I said to my driver: "When
are we coming to the next farm?"</p>

<p>"At the rate we are going," he replied, "it will
take us two hours at least."</p>

<p>"Then let us stop and give a little of the hay you
have brought with you to the horse. After he has
rested a while, we will start again."</p>

<p>After the horse had eaten his hay, we started. We
had not gone long, however, before we were upset.
The horse had not kept to the road. We had a hard
time to right the sleigh and bring the horse back to
firm snow. It was such hard work that the perspiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was dripping from our faces, though it was 23
degrees below zero.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of this travelling," I said to
the driver; "the snow is too deep and soft to go on.
The snow-ploughs have not done much good here.
They evidently could not go far."</p>

<p>"I do not believe," he replied, "that horses will
be given to you at the next post station, even if we
should reach there to-day. But I am sure we cannot
do it, and we shall have to stop at the first farm we
meet and ask the farmer for shelter until people can
travel on the road again."</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards I saw in the distance a little
hamlet, or a number of farms close together. What
a sight! Many of the small houses were buried in
the snow, and only their roofs or chimneys could be
seen. From some of the chimneys smoke was curling
upwards. I was delighted.</p>

<p>Every one was busy digging and making trenches,
so that the light and air might reach the windows, or
that communication could be had between the buildings,
especially those where the animals were housed.
In some cases the exit had first to be made through
the chimney.</p>

<p>It was a very strange sight indeed! and I said to
myself, "Surely I am in 'Snow Land.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Halt at a Farmhouse.&mdash;Made Welcome.&mdash;A Strange-looking
Interior.&mdash;Queer Beds.&mdash;Snowed in.&mdash;Exit Through the
Chimney.&mdash;Clearing Paths.&mdash;I Resume my Journey.&mdash;Reach
Haparanda.</p></div>


<p class="cap">SOON after we stopped at one of these farms. A
trench about fifteen feet deep had been made,
leading to the door of the dwelling-house. Here lived
friends of my driver. I alighted and walked through
the narrow trench and opened the storm door. In
the little hall hung long coats lined with woolly sheepskin;
on the floor were wooden shoes, shovels, axes,
etc. A ladder stood upright against the wall.</p>

<p>I opened the other door. As I entered I found
myself in a large room. I saluted the farmer and family.
They all looked at me with astonishment, for I
was not one of the neighbors, and who could I be!</p>

<p>The farmer said: "What are you doing, stranger, on
the highroad with snow so deep, and when travelling
is suspended, snow-ploughs abandoned, horses belonging
to them gone to the nearest farms? You cannot
go further until the snow packs itself with its own
weight, and the snow-ploughs and rollers are able to
work on the road. Did you come here on skees?"</p>

<p>"No, I drove," I replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is your horse?"</p>

<p>"At the gate," I answered.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am going north as far as the extremity of Northern
Europe. I want to be in that land during the
time of 'The Long Night,' when no sun is to be seen
for weeks; but I am afraid I cannot travel further for
a few days on account of the deep snow, and I
shall have to wait; and as we cannot go further and
reach the post station, I come to ask you if you can
give shelter to a stranger far from his country."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," he replied; and his wife added,
"We are poor people, we have a humble home, for
our farm is small, but you will have the best we have."</p>

<p>"I thank you ever so much," I replied.</p>

<p>The farmer put more wood on the fire, the sticks
being placed upright, in which manner they throw out
much more heat, and a sudden blaze filled the room
with a bright glow.</p>

<p>I like these farmers' fireplaces. They are always
built of masonry in one of the corners of the room.
The platform is about one foot above the floor and
generally four or five feet square, with a crane to hang
kettles or cooking pots on; and when only the embers
remain a trap in the chimney is closed, to prevent
the heat from getting out.</p>

<p>The wife put the coffee kettle over the fire, and one
of the daughters kept herself busy with the coffee
mill.</p>

<p>In the mean time my driver came in and was welcomed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and they asked him about me. When they
heard I was from America they shouted, "From America!"
and when they had recovered from their astonishment,
the husband said, "I have a brother in
America." The wife said, "I have a sister and two
nieces in America," and tears came into her eyes.
They did also into mine; there was at once a bond of
union between us. To them the United States was so
far away, and I was so far from home. They often
thought of their folks and friends who had emigrated
to our land.</p>

<p>The family was composed of three daughters and
two sons. The girls had fair hair and large blue eyes,
and were strong enough to be victorious in a wrestling
contest with big boys.</p>

<p>The sons helped their father on the farm. The
names of the girls were: Engla Matilda, Serlotta Maria,
and Kajsa Maria; the mother Lovisa Kristina; the
father Carl; the sons were Nils and Erik.</p>

<p>The big room was strange-looking. In one corner
was the large open fireplace. A large hand loom,
with an unfinished piece of thick coarse woollen stuff
or cloth which was being woven, was in another corner.
Near by were three spinning-wheels; upon one
was flax and on the two others wool. On the walls
were shelves for plates, saucers, glasses, mugs, dishes,
etc.</p>

<p>The ceiling was about eight or nine feet in height.
There was an opening in it which was accessible by a
ladder. I wanted very much to know what there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
above. Along the walls were several wooden benches
like sofas, upon which the people sat. A large wooden
table with wooden benches and two or three wooden
chairs completed the furniture. There was a trap-door
in the middle of the floor, leading into the cellar;
and as this never froze, the potatoes and other vegetables,
the butter and cheese, and ale were kept there.</p>

<p>By the side of the living-room were two doors leading
to two small rooms. One had shelves for
pails containing milk and the churn to make butter
with. In the other room were a number of painted
chests, with the initials of the owners upon them, and
lots of dresses hanging along the walls, and a bed.</p>

<p>The husband suddenly disappeared through the
trap-door and soon came back with potatoes and a
big piece of bacon. The sight roused my appetite.
The potatoes were washed and boiled, and the pan
was put over the fire and the bacon cut into slices
and fried.</p>

<p>The meal was put on a very clean table without
tablecloth, and then the driver and I were bidden to
sit down and eat. Our coffee cups were filled to the
brim, and every two or three minutes we were urged
to eat more, to drink more coffee. How good were
the potatoes! How good were the bacon and the
cheese and the butter! I thought that that meal
tasted better than any I had eaten in my life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="600" height="383" alt="" title="" />
"The husband suddenly disappeared through the trap-door and soon came back with potatoes and a big
piece of bacon."</div>

<p>When we stopped, for we had eaten to our hearts'
content, with one voice husband and wife said: "Eat
more, eat more;" and before I knew it, our two cups<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
were filled for the third time, and more potatoes and
bacon were put on our plates. They all seemed so
happy to see us eat with such an appetite.</p>

<p>The dear farmers of Norway and Sweden were
always so hospitable and kind to me. Do not wonder
that I love them. No one in these countries
has ever tried to do me harm or ever robbed me of
a penny.</p>

<p>After our meal we stretched our legs before the
open fireplace. I was more happy than if I had been
in a splendid palace. I forgot the snow and storm.
How nice it was to be in front of a fireplace when the
storm was raging!</p>

<p>The farmer put more sticks on the fire. The
room was in a perfect blaze of light. Gradually the
fire died out, and when there were only embers left
he stirred them with the poker until not a particle
of flame appeared, and when there was no danger of
fumes he shut the trap so that no heat would escape
through the chimney. The time of going to bed had
come.</p>

<p>I was wondering all the time where we were all
going to sleep, for there were no beds in sight. "Perhaps,"
said I to myself, "we are all going up the
ladder to sleep upstairs. Perhaps we are going to
sleep on the floor." But I did not see any mattress,
sheepskins, or home-made woollen blankets
anywhere&mdash;and these when together would have
made a big pile.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the daughters come to the bench-like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sofas and pull out a drawer out of each sofa.
These were to be the beds. They were filled with
hay, with two sheepskins on the top to be used as
sheets and blankets.</p>

<p>These sliding boxes could be made of different
widths, according to the number of occupants that
were to sleep in the same bed.</p>

<p>I said to myself, "Strange-looking beds these,"
when one of the girls said, "Sometimes we can
squeeze five or six into one of these beds." I was
glad I was not going to be the fifth or sixth, for we
should have been packed like sardines or herring.</p>

<p>When everything was ready the boys ascended the
ladder and went to sleep upstairs. A bed was given
me, and the rest of the family slept in their own,
two girls sleeping in one bed. Then we bade each
other good-night. How warm and comfortable were
my sheepskins!</p>

<p>In the middle of the night I heard the howling of
the wind; a terrific gale was blowing. How thankful
I felt to be under shelter! Early in the morning,
while still in bed, I was startled by the shouts of one
of the boys: "Father, we are snowed in! We cannot
get out of the house!"</p>

<p>"Are we snowed in?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," shouted the two boys at the same time.
I jumped out of bed to find out if it was a joke. It
was true!</p>

<p>The boys were delighted, and said with great glee:
"The wind has filled all the trenches with snow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
We shall have to get out through the chimney.
What fun that will be!"</p>

<p>I thought also that it would be fun. I had never
got out of a house through the chimney, and I was
anxious now to do it, for I might never get another
chance.</p>

<p>Everybody was now out of bed. "It is good that
the cellar is full of potatoes and that a sack of the
Russian flour has not been touched, so we have plenty
of food," said the father. "Besides, there is bacon,
cheese, and butter," said one of the girls. Another
added, "We have inside firewood for three days without
being obliged to go to the woodshed."</p>

<p>The farmer said, "There has never been so much
snow during living man's memory. Old Pehr, my
neighbor, whom I went to see yesterday, and who is
eighty-four years old, said that he never remembered
such a snowstorm."</p>

<p>I thought of the poor horse that had worked so
hard to bring us here. "Boys, we must make the
way clear to the stable and feed your horse and
mine," I said. "Let us hurry and go out through
the chimney."</p>

<p>"They are all right," said the father; "I left so
much fodder before them that they will not starve even
if we could not reach them to-day."</p>

<p>"Dear horses, how useful to us," I said. "I often
wonder that there are some men so cruel and so hard-hearted
as to beat the poor animals when they have
not strength enough to carry the heavy load put upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
them, or to make them work when they are ill. It
is a good thing that there are societies in many countries
for the prevention of cruelty to horses and other
animals."</p>

<p>"It is so," said they all with one voice; "we do not
know of any one among our neighbors who is unkind
to his horse. We do not know what we should do
if our poor horse were ill."</p>

<p>"Yes," said one of the girls, "when he was a colt
our horse used to put his head through the door to
get pieces of potatoes and apples. We love him!"</p>

<p>The ladder was fetched and put into the chimney.
There was no trouble about that, for the chimney
was so wide. The shovels were brought in. There
were three of them. Then Nils ascended the ladder,
and afterwards crept to the top. This was a hard job.
Erik followed, and succeeded also in reaching the roof.
Then we heard voices coming down the chimney.</p>

<p>"Father," called the boys, "tie the shovels to
the cord we drop." They had taken the precaution
of carrying a cord with them. The shovels were
hauled up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="" />
"The boys got hold of my hands and pulled me through."</div>

<p>Then my turn came to go through. I got into
the chimney first, and saw the faces of Nils and Erik
peeping down. "It is all right. Come on, Herr
Paul." I ascended the ladder, then crept up the rest
of the chimney. The boys got hold of my hands
and pulled me through. What a sight! I was black
with soot. Nils and Erik were likewise. We gave
three great hurrahs. We shouted through the chimney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to the folks with great glee, "Be patient, you
will get out by and by."</p>

<p>We worked with a will, and succeeded in clearing
the trench leading to the door, and there was a great
shout of joy when it opened. Then the girls came
out and joined us in making the way clear to the barn,
to the two horses, five cows, and twelve sheep. When
we opened the door of the barn the horses neighed,
the cows lowed, and the sheep baaed. It was a fine
concert of voices. They were glad to see us. It was
their way of bidding us welcome.</p>

<p>Returning to the house we cleared the windows,
then the well, of snow. The well was surrounded by
a mass of ice. We drew water and gave a good drink
to the horses and the other animals. The girls milked
the cows, and gave fresh fodder to all.</p>

<p>When our work was done we were all as hungry
as the wolves are in winter, when they have had no
food for days.</p>

<p>In the mean time the mother had prepared a big
meal for us, and we entered the house. We were
ready to do justice to the food. The potatoes and
the bacon quickly disappeared. After the meal we
cleared the other windows of snow, and made passages
to them, so that light might come through. It was
a hard day's work all round!</p>

<p>When supper time came we seated ourselves before
a big wooden bowl of porridge called "gr&ouml;d," made
from barley meal. On each side were two wooden
bowls filled with sour milk. We ate with wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
spoons from the same dish. There were no plates
for supper, and once in a while we took a spoonful of
sour milk to help the gr&ouml;d go down. I always enjoy
eating with wooden or horn spoons.</p>

<p>I went to sleep in the loft this time. I wanted
to be near Nils and Erik. They were fine boys,
and we were friends. Did we not sleep well that
night! We did not awake until their father came to
shake us.</p>

<p>"There is nothing like shovelling snow to make
one sleep," we all said, after we awoke.</p>

<p>The next day the women were very busy a great
part of the day. Engla spun flax on her spinning-wheel,
Serlotta carded wool, and Maria wove a thick
woollen cloth to be turned into garments for three
new suits for her father and two brothers, while the
mother knitted woollen stockings.</p>

<p>I remained three days on this farm. During that
time the snow had packed and the snow-ploughs followed
by the rollers had made their reappearance on
the highroad. It was time for me to leave, for I was
in a hurry, and I had to travel nearly nine hundred
miles before I could reach Nordkyn.</p>

<p>When I left I put some money into the hands of
the wife, and when she felt it in her hand she said,
"No, no; to be paid for giving food and shelter to a
person who is overtaken by a storm, is a shame.
What would God think of me for doing that? No,
no;" she said again, with more earnestness.</p>

<p>I succeeded at last, after much insistence, in overcoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
her scruples and making her take it; and once
more I was on the road leading northward.</p>

<p>Travelling was still very difficult. I came late to
a post station where I intended to spend the night, for
I was very tired. The place was filled with travellers
and all the beds were taken. Men slept on benches,
on the top of the table, and on the floor. These
were travellers who had been detained on the road
and were once more on their way southward.</p>

<p>I saw a space on the floor between two men&mdash;just
enough for me to get in&mdash;and I quietly stepped over
three fellows who were fast asleep and made for the
empty place, and went to sleep in my fur coat.</p>

<p>The next morning I was once more on the long
and tedious road leading north, towards "The Land of
the Long Night." That afternoon I reached the
little town of Ume&aring;.</p>

<p>The days had become shorter and shorter. The
sun was very low at noon and was not above the
horizon more than one hour. As I travelled further
north I was surprised to notice that the snow diminished
rapidly. I had left the great "Snow Land," or
snow belt, which seemed to be between 62 and 64
degrees north, behind me.</p>

<p>After changing horses at several post stations I
came to the little towns of Skellefte&aring;, Pite&aring;, and Lule&aring;,
and at last I reached Haparanda, situated at the extreme
northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, at the
mouth of the Torne river, the most northern town
in Sweden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>At Haparanda I had driven about seven hundred
and forty miles from Stockholm, and over twenty-five
hundred miles since I had left the mountains of Norway.
I was only forty-one miles south of the Arctic
Circle, which is the most southerly part of "The Land
of the Long Night."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Good Advice from the People of Haparanda.&mdash;Warned against
Still Colder Weather.&mdash;Different Costume Needed.&mdash;Dressed
as a Laplander.&mdash;Lapp Grass for Feet Protection.</p></div>


<p class="cap">I HAD hardly arrived in Haparanda, when the
leading people of the place came to welcome me.
I was not unknown to several of them, on account of
some of my books which have been translated into
Swedish; and they were my friends at once.</p>

<p>They heard with astonishment that I intended to
go further north. They looked serious and remained
silent for a while. "We will give you letters of
introduction to our friends," they said; "but after
a time you will be too far north, where we do not
know anybody. You will find only Finlanders and
Laplanders until you come to the Arctic shores of
Norway."</p>

<p>After saying this they began to fill their big meerschaum
pipes with tobacco and lighted them, and
smoke came out as if from a small funnel. They
gave puff after puff and were again silent; the
wrinkles over their foreheads showed that they were
thoughtful and anxious.</p>

<p>One friend said: "The country which lies between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the head of the Gulf of Bothnia and Nordkyn, the
most northern part of the mainland in Europe, is very
stormy in winter, the winds blow with terrific force,
and midway between the shores of the Baltic and the
extremity of the land snow is also very deep. It is
a roadless land."</p>

<p>When I heard this, I said to myself: "Is 'The
Land of the Long Night' 'Snow Land' as well?"
Then I thought of the great "Snow Land" I had
left behind me, and how hard travelling had been,
and I wondered if it would be worse in this second
"Snow Land." If it was, then I had a hard task
ahead of me.</p>

<p>Another friend said, "This big overcoat of yours
will never do in the country you are going to. These
long boots you wear will not be serviceable."</p>

<p>"Yes," they all said together. "This costume of
yours will be unmanageable on account of the wind.
You cannot travel in 'The Land of the Long Night'
dressed as you are. You must dress like a Laplander.
Theirs is the only costume that can stand the weather
you are to encounter, the only one in which you will
be able to get into their small sleighs, and face the
fierce wind and the intense cold."</p>

<p>"Remember," said another of my new friends,
"that you are going to travel over a roadless country
covered with snow, the reindeer will be your horse,
and you will not be able to go about without going
on skees, for at every step one sinks deep into the
snow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Then another added, to reassure me: "Our country
is a country of laws; we have order, and hate lawlessness.
You will feel safe among the people. You
will find where the country is uninhabited, or where the
farms are very wide apart, houses or farms of refuge
where you can get food and reindeer to take you
further on. These are post stations where you can
remain until the weather is good. There you are as
safe as among us."</p>

<p>I thanked them for all the advice and information
they gave me and said that I would follow their
admonition in regard to my dress. They then bade
me good-night. The next day I remembered what my
friends had said to me the day before, and with one
of them I went to get the garments worn by the Lapps.</p>

<p>I bought two "kaptor."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These are also called
"pesh." They are long blouses reaching down to the
knee or below, made of reindeer skins, with fur
attached; with a narrow aperture for the head to pass
through, and fitting closely round the neck.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Plural form. Singular, "kapta."</p></div>

<p>One of the kaptor was much larger than the other,
for in case of intense cold one is worn beneath the
other with the fur inside, and the outside one with
the fur outside.</p>

<p>I got a pair of trousers made of skin from the legs
of the reindeer, of which the fur though short is considered
the warmest part of the animal, as it protects
his legs, which are always in the snow. The provisions
of nature are wonderful!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>There are no openings to the Lapp trousers, so
that no cold air can reach the body. They are
fastened round the waist by a string and are tied
above the ankle. There the fur is removed and the
leather is made very soft so that it may go round the
shoe.</p>

<p>I got two pairs of shoes made of the skin of the
reindeer near the hoof, with the fur outside. This
part is said to be the warmest part of the whole skin.
All the Lapp shoes are sharp pointed, the point turning
upward. They are bound at the seams with red
flannel. The upper part fits above the ankle. They
were large enough for me to wear two pairs of thick,
home-knitted stockings and Lapp grass to surround
the foot everywhere without pinching it. Long
narrow bands of bright color are attached to them.
These bands are wound around the legs above the
ankles, thus preventing snow and wind from penetrating.
These shoes can only be used in cold weather
when the snow is crisp, and are especially adapted for
skees, as they are pointed and have no heels.</p>

<p>I procured also four pairs of mittens, one made of
the skin of the reindeer near the hoof, another of
wool with a sort of down, the third of cow's hair, and
the fourth of goat's hair; the two latter are the warmest,
but they are very perishable.</p>

<p>I also got two pairs of very thick home-knitted
stockings. These were of wool. I succeeded in getting
two other pairs made of cow's hair, and another
pair made of goat's hair, and I was especially cautioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to handle them gently when I put them on or took them
off&mdash;likewise with the mittens of goat's and cow's hair.</p>

<p>I also got a vest made of soft reindeer skin to put
on over my underwear, and two sets of thick underwear
of homespun, for these are much warmer than
those that are made by machinery.</p>

<p>I added to my outfit one pair of long and another
shorter pair of boots for wet weather in the spring,
when the snow is damp and watery. These boots
were made of the skin of the lower part of the hind
legs of reindeer, the fur being scraped off. The
leather is black and it is prepared in such a way as to
exclude water or moisture. They were rubbed with
a composition of reindeer fat and tar.</p>

<p>Then I bought a square Lapp cap, the top filled
with eider down. The rim could be turned down to
protect the ears and the forehead.</p>

<p>After procuring my Lapp outfit, I thought I would
try to dress myself in my new garments. The friend
who accompanied me said: "I will show you how to
prepare your feet before you put your shoes on.
One can never be too careful, otherwise the feet are
sure to be cold on a journey."</p>

<p>I put on my two new pairs of hand-knitted stockings.
He surrounded my feet over the stockings
with Lapp grass; then he put my shoe on most carefully,
with the lower part of the trousers inside, and
then wound the bands not too tight round my ankle,
saying, "Now your feet will be warm all day even if
you spend all your time on skees. You see how careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I have been in putting on your shoes. Dressed
as you are you can defy the cold. If you follow the
advice I have given you, you will never have cold feet
no matter how long you drive or walk in the snow.
But take great care that neither shoes, nor stockings,
nor grass be damp. I think it will be well for you to
let a Lapp or a Finn put your shoes on before you
start on a long journey&mdash;until you can do it yourself
quite well."</p>

<p>The "shoe grass" of which I have spoken grows
in the Arctic regions in pools in the summer. It is
gathered in great quantity by the Laplanders and Finlanders,
who dry it and keep it carefully, for it is
indispensable in winter in their land of snow and cold.
It has the peculiarity of retaining heat and keeping
the feet warm and absorbing the moisture. I always
travelled with a good stock of that grass, twisted and
knotted together in small bundles.</p>

<p>Then I looked at myself in the looking-glass, and
for the first time saw how I appeared in my new outfit,
my Lapp costume. The frontispiece will show
you exactly how I was dressed (without a hood),
for it is from a photograph. Unfortunately, being a
bachelor, I don't know how to take care of things, and
my costume, gloves, stockings, and mittens have been
eaten up by moths, and I have had to throw them
away. But I appeared before the American Geographical
Society in New York dressed in this suit, seated in
my Lapp sleigh, with a stuffed reindeer harnessed to
it, and my bearskin over me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>To complete my outfit I added two large reindeer-skin
bags, one larger, so that the smaller one could be
put inside it without much difficulty. I was to sleep in
these bags when obliged to rest out doors on the snow.
One bag was sufficient in ordinary cold weather&mdash;say
15 or 20 degrees below zero; the other I would use
when the thermometer ranged from 25 to 40 or 50
degrees below zero.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>What the Arctic Circle is.&mdash;Description of the Phenomenon of
the Long Night.&mdash;Reasons for its Existence.&mdash;The Ecliptic
and the Equinoxes.&mdash;Length of the Long Night at Different
Places.</p></div>


<p class="cap">NOW I was ready to go further northward beyond
the Arctic Circle, and roam in "The Land
of the Long Night."</p>

<p>The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line, just as are
the Equator and the two Tropics, going round the
earth, and begins at 66&deg; 32' north latitude and is 1623
miles from the North Pole. It is the southernmost
limit of the region where the sun disappears in winter,
under the horizon, for one day.</p>

<p>At the North Pole on the 22nd of September the
sun descends to the horizon and then disappears till
the 20th of March, when it reappears and remains in
sight above the horizon until the 22nd of September.
So at the pole the year is made of one day and one
night. On the 22nd day of December it disappears
at the Arctic Circle for one day only. The space between
the Arctic Circle and the pole is therefore called
the Arctic region, or the Frigid Zone. Consequently,
the further one advances to the north, the longer the
duration of the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I will tell you the causes of this phenomenon of
the Long Night. The earth revolves about the sun
once every year, and rotates on its axis once in twenty-four
hours, which makes what we call a day.</p>

<p>Rotate means to move round a centre; thus the
daily turning of the earth on its axis is a rotation. Its
annual course round the sun is called a revolution.</p>

<p>The axis about which the daily rotation takes place
is an imaginary straight line passing through the centre
of the earth, and its extremities are called poles, hence
the names of the North and the South pole. The diurnal
movement is from West to East and takes place
in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The earth's orbit, or the path described by it in its
annual revolution about the sun, is, so to speak, a
flattened circle, somewhat elongated, called an ellipse.
The axis of the earth is not perpendicular to the plane
of the orbit, which is an imaginary flat surface enclosed
by the line of the earth's revolution, but is inclined to
it at an angle of 23&deg; 28', which angle is called the
obliquity of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the path or
way among the fixed stars which the earth in its orbit
appears to describe to an eye placed in the sun, for the
sun is the fixed centre and not the earth. The earth,
therefore, in moving about the sun, is not upright, but
inclined, so that in different parts of its course it
always presents a half, but always a different half, of its
surface to the sun.</p>

<p>Twice in the year, 21st of March and 21st of September,
the exact half of the earth along its axis is illuminated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
On these dates, therefore, any point on the
earth's surface is, during the rotation of the earth on
its axis, half the time in light and half the time in
darkness,&mdash;that is, day and night are twelve hours each
all over the globe.</p>

<p>These two dates are called equinoxes, March 21st
being the vernal, and September 21st being the autumnal,
equinox.</p>

<p>As the earth moves in its orbit after March 21st,
the North Pole inclines more and more towards the
sun, till June 21st, after which it turns away from it.
On September 21st day and night are again equal all
over the earth, and after this the North Pole is turned
away from the sun, and does not receive its light
again till the following March.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that from the autumnal to the
vernal equinox the North Pole is in darkness and
has a night of six months' duration, during which time
the sun is not seen. Therefore, any point near the
pole is, during any given twenty-four hours, longer
in darkness than in light.</p>

<p>The number of days of constant darkness depends
on the latitude of the observer. At the pole the sun
is not seen for six months, at the Arctic Circle it is
invisible, as I have said, for only one day in December.
At North Cape and Nordkyn the sun disappears
November 18th, and is not seen again till January
24th. That is the reason I have called the land
between North Cape and the Arctic Circle "The
Land of the Long Night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>This "Land of the Long Night" commences at
Nordkyn, or the most northern point of the continent
of Europe,&mdash;or at North Cape, but five miles
distant&mdash;on the 16th of November. The whole sun
appears on that day, its lower rim just touching above
the horizon at noon. The next day, 17th of November,
the lower half of the sun has disappeared, and the
following day, the 18th, it sinks below the horizon
and does not show itself again until the 24th of January&mdash;hence
the night there lasts sixty-seven days
of twenty-four hours each. And at the Arctic Circle
the sun is only completely hidden on the 22nd of
December.</p>

<p>The following table shows you the dates of the
disappearance of the sun, and of its reappearance at
the principal places to which we are going.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Fine Weather Leaving Haparanda.&mdash;Windstorms Succeed.&mdash;A
Finlander's Farm.&mdash;Strange Fireplace.&mdash;Interior of
a Cow-house.&mdash;Queer Food for Cattle.&mdash;Passing the
Arctic Circle.</p></div>


<p class="cap">I LEFT Haparanda in the beginning of January,
surrounded by the friends who had taken such
an interest in me. The atmosphere was clear, and
not a cloud was to be seen in the pale blue sky, turning
into greenish as it approached the horizon. There
was not a breath of wind. Once the thermometer
marked 30 degrees below zero.</p>

<p>"Be careful," said my friends. "This is treacherous
weather for ears and noses, there is danger of their
getting frozen; rub them, and also your face, now and
then with snow. Keep your ears covered, and protect
them with your hood. If it becomes colder put
on your mask."</p>

<p>I thanked them for their kind advice, but replied:
"No mask for me just now, I want to breathe this
pure invigorating air as much as I can. I want it to
reach my lungs."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/005.png" width="600" height="381" alt="" title="" />
"It was indeed, a fearful wind storm."</div>

<p>"Be careful in such weather," they repeated.
"This is beautiful weather indeed, but sometimes it
does not last long and is followed by furious gales,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
or great snowstorms; but we hope this fine weather
will follow you for many days. Often it lasts quite
a while."</p>

<p>Then we bade good-bye to each other. They tucked
the sheepskin round me, and bade the driver to take
good care of Paulus.</p>

<p>Soon after this we were out of Haparanda and on
the highroad leading to Pajala, which was about one
hundred and ten miles further north, there being ten
or twelve post stations between the two places.</p>

<p>Sleighing was fine, the road had been used much,
so we went on at a very fast pace. It was just the
weather people, horses, dogs, and reindeer liked. I
liked it also very much, for it was so exhilarating,
and I felt so well and so strong. I was ready, nevertheless,
for all kinds of weather, and I was fully
prepared to meet great storms, for I wanted to encounter
the blizzards of the Arctic regions just to find
out how strongly the wind could blow. I found out
later!</p>

<p>I changed horses at several post stations during the
day, among them the stations of Korpikyla, Niemis,
Ruskola, and Matarengi. I found that the Finnish
language was now prevalent, Swedish being only spoken
by comparatively few people.</p>

<p>That day was the end of the fine weather. Towards
evening the wind was blowing very hard, and
it increased in strength every minute until it blew a
perfect hurricane. Then what my friends had said to
me came to mind. It was indeed a fearful windstorm!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The gale had become such that the horse at times
did not seem to have strength enough to pull our
sleigh. The snow flew in thick cloudy masses to a
great height, curling and recurling upon itself and
blinding us. Fortunately our robes were fastened
very securely. I wore my hood, and it was so arranged
that my eyes were the only part of my face
that was not covered. The wind was so powerful
that our sleigh was in continual danger of upsetting,
and was only saved because it was so low.</p>

<p>I was glad indeed when I reached the hamlet of
Matarengi with its red-painted log church, two hundred
years old, and separate belfry of the same color.</p>

<p>The windstorm lasted three days. During that time
I found that the temperature varied from 8 to 22
degrees below zero.</p>

<p>Then it became calm, the sky was perfectly clear,
and the mercury marked 40 degrees below zero.
There was not a breath of wind. It was fine, and I
made ready to continue my journey.</p>

<p>Wherever I changed horse and sleigh, before starting
I shook hands with the station master and his family,
and after this bade good-bye to the driver who had
brought me to the place. One must not forget that
little politeness in these northern lands, otherwise the
people would think you ill-bred or proud and would
dislike you. No man has ever made friends by being
proud or conceited. It is, after all, very silly, and
often very ill-bred. I have found that one gets along
much better in the world by being polite and obliging.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
It is so much easier to be pleasant than sour
and gruff. In the former case you are happy; in
the latter discontented and wretched. I always feel
sorry when I meet people who are proud or conceited.
Often I laugh at them in my sleeve, and
when that pride or conceit becomes overbearing I
have great contempt for them, and do not wish to
have anything to do with them.</p>

<p>I approached very fast the regions of "The Land
of the Long Night." The road was filled with
freshly made, huge snowdrifts, which greatly impeded
our progress. Towards noon the wind increased again,
and soon I was in a worse gale than before. I said to
myself, "Now I am indeed in 'The Land of the
Wind.'"</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw dimly through the clouds of snow
the dwellings of a farm. "Let us go there," I said
to my driver, "for we cannot reach the post station
to-day." Our horse evidently thought as we did;
he had made up his mind to go no further, and preferred
to be in a stable. He suddenly turned to the
right, entered the yard, and stopped before the dwelling-house
of the farm. I alighted. I was so dizzy
from the effects of the wind that I could not walk
straight, and tottered about for a minute or more.
My driver was in the same condition.</p>

<p>I entered the house and found myself in a large
room, in the midst of a family of Finlanders, whose
language is very unlike the Swedish or Norwegian.
I was welcomed at once by all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked around, and saw a queer-looking structure,
built of slabs of stone plastered over. It was about
seven feet square, the inside oven-like in shape. They
were just lighting a fire; then the door was closed.
In one section of the structure was an open fireplace
used for cooking.</p>

<p>Poles were secured to the ceiling near the fireplace,
upon which hung garments,&mdash;stockings, shoes, boots,
and other articles. In the middle of the room was
the usual trap-door leading into the cellar. There
were two large hand looms upon which two girls
were weaving. These two looms were very old and
had been several generations in the family. Three
other girls were occupied with wheels, spinning wool
and flax.</p>

<p>Along the walls of this large room, which was
about twenty feet square, were a number of bench-like
sofas, used for beds. Two or three wooden chairs,
and a large wooden table surrounded by wooden
benches, made up the rest of the furniture.</p>

<p>The stove began to heat the room fearfully, for
after the firewood had been reduced to charcoal, and
the fumes from it were gone, the sliding trap-door in
the chimney had been closed, thus preventing the heat
from escaping. The thick walls of the oven-like
stove had been heated, and threw out a great deal of
heat, which to me soon became unbearable.</p>

<p>The farmer said to me that the walls would remain
warm for two or three days. The windows were all
tight; none could be opened, and the only ventilation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
came through the door when some one came in or
went out.</p>

<p>I went out and looked at the farm buildings while
my sleigh was being made ready. I was surprised to
see the buildings of the farm and the big timber of
the log house, for I was so far north. The yard was
enclosed by houses on three sides. The dwelling-house,
the barn, and the cow-houses were the largest
buildings. There were besides a blacksmith shop, a
storehouse, and a shed for carts. All these buildings
were painted red.</p>

<p>In the middle of the yard was an old-fashioned
well, with its sweep, having at one end a bucket and
at the other a heavy stone, and surrounded by a thick
mass of ice. From the well there was a trough
going into the cow-house, which I entered. The
cattle were small and well-shaped and in good order.
The building was very low, the windows very small
and giving but little light. The floor was entirely
planked over, and there were pens on each side.</p>

<p>Looking towards the end of the building I saw a
girl standing by a huge iron pot, about four feet in
diameter and three feet deep, encased in masonry.
She was putting coarse marsh grass into the pot,
which was filled with water made warm by a fire
underneath. "Much of the grass we gather," said
the farmer, "is coarse, and it is so tough that the
cattle cannot eat it; so we have to prepare it in this
way before we give it to them."</p>

<p>A number of sheep were penned in a corner. "Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
three horses," said the farmer, "have a stable for
themselves." This farm was one of the good farms,
and there were a number quite as good. In some
the dwellings are of two stories, but these were the
great exception.</p>

<p>In the mean time supper had been prepared. Dry
mutton as tough as leather but cut very thin, smoked
reindeer meat, hard bread, butter, cheese, two wooden
bowls of buttermilk, and fish were put on the table.
This was a great repast, in my honor. There was no
tablecloth, no napkin, no fork, the flat bread was
used instead of plates, we had wooden spoons for the
sour milk, and helped ourselves to it from the common
dish.</p>

<p>A little after supper came bedtime. The girls,
looking at the clock, which marked nine, suddenly
got up to make the beds ready. They pulled out the
sliding boxes, in one of which three of them were to
sleep. The boxes were filled with straw and hay, and
had homespun blankets or sheepskins, and eider down
or feather pillows. The sofa-like beds were all along
the walls, for there was a large family.</p>

<p>It was well that I was at the farm. A more terrific
windstorm than all those I had seen before, arose
during the night. In the morning the snow swirled
to an immense height, hiding everything from sight;
the whole country was enveloped in a thick cloud;
the huge snowdrifts were carried hither and thither.
The storm lasted two days, and after it was over the
weather became calm, the temperature was 40&deg; below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
zero, and when the atmosphere was very clear we had
about three or four hours of twilight.</p>

<p>Then I bade farewell to the good farmer and his
wife, and once more I was on my way to "The Land
of the Long Night," which was now very near.</p>

<p>The next day I came to a little lake the natives
called Kunsijarvi, and further on I came to still
another lake called Rukojarvi; and between these two
I had crossed the Arctic Circle. But it was January,
the sun showed itself above the horizon at noon.
Near the shore of Lake Rukojarvi was a solitary
farm, where I stopped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Skees, or the Queer Snowshoes of the North.&mdash;How They
Are Made.&mdash;Learning to Use Them.&mdash;Joseff's Instructions.&mdash;Hard
Work at First.&mdash;Going Down Hill.&mdash;I
Bid Joseff Good-bye.</p></div>


<p class="cap">IN the morning Joseff, the owner of the farm, said
to me: "Paulus, before you go further on your
journey you must learn to go on skees; otherwise you
will not be able to travel, for the snow is very deep further
north. I will teach you how to use skees, but in
order to learn you must remain with us for some time."</p>

<p>Then pointing to the lake near by, he said, "This
is the place where you are to learn. It will be easy for
you to walk with them, for the surface of the lake is
smooth and flat."</p>

<p>After saying this, he went into one of the outer
buildings of the farm and came out with several beautiful
pairs of skees, and handed one of them to me
with these words: "I give them to you; when you
wander further north and walk with them, think
of me." I thanked Joseff for his gift and said:
"I will always remember you, also your wife and
your children, without these skees." Then looking at
them, I added, "How beautiful they are! How
proud I shall be when I walk with them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>These skees, or snowshoes of northern Europe, are
made of wood from the fir tree; at their thickest
part, in the centre, they are between four and five
inches in width. Here, where the foot rests, there
is a piece of birch bark fastened, over which there is
a loop, and through this loop the foot passes. That
part of the skee under the foot is concave, and here it
is thickest, so that where it supports the weight of
the person it cannot bend downward. The under
part of the skee is grooved and polished, and soon
becomes by use as smooth as glass. The forward
end turns slightly upward, as you see by the pictures,
so as to pass over the snow easily.</p>

<p>Joseff left me, and soon came back with a good
many more skees; some were not more than six feet
long; one pair was much longer than mine.</p>

<p>After I had looked at them, he said, "The short
ones are used in the forest, especially among the
Lapps, where pine, fir, or birch trees are close together,
for there long skees cannot be used; but a
heavily built man must have longer ones." Then
pointing to the long pair, which were about fourteen
feet long, he said, "These long skees are used chiefly
in the province of Jemtland, which you passed on the
shores of the Baltic on your way here. The snow is
generally very deep there, and after a great snow fall,
when it is very soft, long skees are needed so that
they can bear up the weight of a man and not sink
too deeply. Here we use skees of about the size of
the pair I gave you, sometimes a little longer; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
you are not a heavy man, so longer ones are not
necessary for you. They will be able to support
your weight without going deeply into the snow, even
when it is soft."</p>

<p>Then showing another pair, he said, "These have
sealskin under them. They are used in the spring
when the snow is soft and becomes watery; the skin
prevents the snow from sticking to the skee."</p>

<p>The following morning we started with our skees
for the lake, I carrying mine on my shoulders. When
we reached the lake Joseff said, "Put your feet under
the loops, and you must manage to keep them there,
just as you would do if you had an old pair of slippers
much too large for you. You would have all the
time to push your feet forward to keep them on. Do
likewise with the skees. Your sharp-pointed Lapp
shoes will help you to do this, as they somewhat prevent
the slipping of the skee. It will be a little difficult
at first, but it will not take long for you to learn
to do this. Constant practice will be the best teacher,
and you will soon be able to walk with them."</p>

<p>Then Joseff gave me two staves to propel myself
with. At the end of each was an iron spike, and
above it a guard of wicker-work, about ten inches in
diameter, to prevent the stick from sinking deeper.
"These staves," he added, "are very useful when the
snow is soft and the skees do not glide easily. Then
propelling oneself with them makes one go faster.
Though the snow is packed they will help you, as you
are a beginner. The most important point to learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is to keep the skees always parallel with each other;
this is somewhat difficult at first. Never raise your
feet or skees above the ground; make them glide on
the snow; push one foot forward, then the other,
just as when you walk."</p>

<p>Then he got on his skees, and said: "Now, look
at me and see how I go." I saw him gliding on the
snow, pushing first one foot then the other, the two
skees running parallel with each other; and when one
had a tendency to go inside or outside, he corrected
the deviation at once by a slight movement of his leg
and foot. I noticed afterward that with many persons
the ankle was very flexible, owing to their going so
much on skees.</p>

<p>After going some distance he returned to me, and
we started slowly together. I pushed first one foot
then the other forward, and tried to do exactly what
he had told me to do; but before I knew it the end
of one skee overlapped the other and stopped my
advance at once. Fortunately I was going slowly,
otherwise I should have landed on the snow. "The
overlapping of one skee over the other is quite common
with a beginner," said my teacher to me.</p>

<p>Putting my skees in position again, we started.
This time one of my skees left me. Several times the
two left me, and I found myself seated on the snow
every time. I made slow progress that day. At the
end of the lesson Joseff said, "Do not be discouraged,
Paulus, you will soon learn the knack. I will
now show you how fast a man can go on skees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Look at me." Then he started; he seemed simply to
fly over the snow, and before many minutes he was
far away, almost out of sight. He was going at the
rate of at least twenty miles an hour.</p>

<p>I said to myself: "O Paul, when will you go as
fast as Joseff!" I was filled with ambition. I wanted
to learn as fast as I could, and I thought I would take
lessons every day.</p>

<p>When he returned the perspiration was dripping
from his face, though the cold was 39 degrees below
zero.</p>

<p>I spent several hours every day on the lake, learning
and practising, and when Joseff had time he would
come with me; and after three days I was able to
manage the skees tolerably well. I kept them in line
and they did not slip out from my feet any more. I
could go several thousand yards without stopping and
with no mishaps.</p>

<p>After I could do this, Joseff said to me: "Paulus,
you know now how to go well on skees upon level
land; now you must learn how to go down hill with
them. This is difficult, and I do not know whether
in one winter you can learn how to do it&mdash;at least so
as to go down the slopes of mountains; one has to
have learned that in boyhood&mdash;but I will teach you
anyhow to go down hill safely."</p>

<p>We left the farm and went on with our skees until
we came to the foot of a pretty steep hill. Then
Joseff said: "We will stop here, and I will teach
you to go down hill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>I noticed that he said this with a roguish eye, which
was full of fun, and I began to suspect that things
were not to go as smoothly as when I was taught on
the lake. "We cannot ascend this steep hill straight
forward, for the skees would slip backward. We
must ascend in zigzag," said Joseff; and then with
his staff he showed me how we were to go. "Follow
my furrow, then it will be easier for you," said he. I
found it hard enough, and slow work. When we
reached the top of the hill we were very warm, though
that day it was 32 degrees below zero. I was wet with
perspiration.</p>

<p>After a rest, Joseff said: "Paulus, look at me."
Straightening his skees and armed with his staff he
leaned his body forward, and down he went, faster
than boys coasting down a very steep hill at home.
It was fine, and I wished I could learn quickly and
go down hill as fast as he did.</p>

<p>When he had ascended the hill again, Joseff said
to me: "Now, Paulus, get ready." He saw that my
skees were in position, and saying, "Bend your body
far forward as you go down," he shouted "Go!" At
this word I bent my body forward as he had told
me, and down I went; but I got scared, as I was
going very fast, and forgot to follow his advice;
straightened myself and bent backward, and before
I knew it my skees slipped from my feet. I was
unskeed just like a man who is unhorsed, and was
seated on the snow looking at my skees, which were
going forward down the steep hill and only stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
at its base, to the great amusement of Joseff, who
evidently expected something of the kind. "The
tendency of a beginner," he explained, "is to bend
backward, thinking that by doing so he will be able
not to go so fast; this invariably brings about the
same result, and he falls."</p>

<p>After a good laugh from both of us, Joseff said:
"Paulus, try again; but this time I will teach you to
go down hill in another way." He gave me his big
stick, and said, "Ride this, and rest upon it as heavily
as you can, so that a great part of your weight shall be
on the end that sinks into the snow, and before you
start let the stick be in the snow about three inches
deep. Thus you will be prevented from going down
too fast. Don't forget to start with your skees running
straight along side of each other." I went down
riding the stick, and reached the bottom of the hill in
safety. I felt very proud of my success, but thought
that if I could ever do this like Joseff how happy I
should be.</p>

<p>Then Joseff gave me another warning. "Paulus,"
said he, "people must look out carefully not to run
into boulders as they go down hill, and a hill full of
boulders only those who can guide their skees well
can venture to go down. Avoid such hills when you
are further north, for otherwise you might even be
killed."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/006.png" width="394" height="550" alt="" title="" />
"Paulus, try again!"</div>

<p>Shortly after our return to the farm the wind began
again to rise, and another terrific windstorm blew over
the land. The hillocks of snow were swept from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
where they stood and new hillocks were made in
other places. When I went out the wind almost took
me off my feet.</p>

<p>I found that my friends in Haparanda were right.
The Lapp costume is well adapted for cold weather.
Nothing is warmer than reindeer skin, and it is convenient
either when the wearer is driving in his Lapp
sleigh, walking or travelling on skees, or when breasting
violent windstorms.</p>

<p>I finally bade good-bye to Joseff, and thanked him
for having taught me to go on skees. And I continued
my journey northward, with a guide to show
me the way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>A Primitive Steam Bath House.&mdash;How the Bath was Prepared.&mdash;What
are the Twigs for?&mdash;I Ascertain.&mdash;Rolling in the
Snow.&mdash;Fine Effect of the Bath.</p></div>


<p class="cap">A FEW miles further on I came to a little hamlet
composed of a few farms. The inhabitants
were all Finlanders. Travelling was so bad, on account
of the big drifts of snow, that I decided to stay a
few days in the place. The following day was Saturday
and the afternoon was the beginning of Sunday,
and the boys and the young men of the place said to
me: "Paulus, to-day is bathing day. Every Saturday
we have a bath."</p>

<p>"All right, boys," I replied, "I will have a bath
with you." Of course they did not mean a water
bath, but a steam bath.</p>

<p>Pointing to a little log building, they said, "Paulus,
this is the bath house. Come, and we will show you
how we work out a steam bath in our country. You
see the bath house stands away from other buildings,
to prevent the fire from spreading in case it should
start anywhere."</p>

<p>So I went with them to the bath house and got in.
It was dark, and no light or air could come in except
through the door. The room was about fifteen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
eighteen feet long and about ten or twelve feet wide.
In the centre there was an oven-like structure, made of
boulders piled upon each other without any cement
whatever. Along the walls were three rows of seats,
made simply from the branches of trees and rising one
above the other, just like seats at a circus, the first one
being near the ground. The people had brought
wood beforehand. This they put into the oven and
set fire to it. They said to me, "We are going to
keep the fire burning all the time, to heat the stones,
and when they are burning hot this afternoon we will
stop the fire, the place will be cleaned, and then we
will take our bath."</p>

<p>We were soon obliged to go out, on account of
the smoke. And the fire was kept up all day,
boys coming now and then with more firewood to
add to it.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I went with two women who
cleaned the place thoroughly and took away the ashes,
and a big vessel put next the oven was filled with water.
Slender boughs of birch trees were brought in, and I
wondered why. I found out later! Finally word
was sent round that everything was ready.</p>

<p>Then my new friends said to me, "Paulus, you
will undress in your room and come to the bath
room with nothing on, for there is no place there
to dress or to hang your clothes. We all go there
naked."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "it is 30 degrees below zero."</p>

<p>"That is nothing," they answered, laughing. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bath house is close by&mdash;just a stone's throw from
your place, and you will find it warm enough there,"
upon which they left me to get ready themselves.</p>

<p>When I was undressed I looked through the windows
and saw men and boys without clothes on running
towards the bath house, which they entered
quickly and shut the door.</p>

<p>It did not take me much time to reach the bath
house. I ran double quick to it. Oh! wasn't it cold
on the way! But as soon as I was in I could feel the
great heat from the oven. It was so warm, and felt so
good after coming from the icy air.</p>

<p>Then water was taken from the large vessel and
thrown over the stones with a big dipper. Steam rose
at once; then more water was thrown, until the place
was full of steam. I could not stand it. It was too
hot for me. "Don't stand up, Paulus," they said;
"sit on the lower seat." Even that was too high for
me. I sat on the floor until I got accustomed to
breathing the hot air. The perspiration was fairly running
down my body. More water was poured and
more steam was raised.</p>

<p>Then one of the fellows said, "Paulus, let me give
you a switching with the birch twigs. It is fine; it
brings the blood into circulation." One of the boys
began to switch my back, and soon I cried, "Enough,
enough, enough!" Soon all were switching one another,
and the one who had switched me said, "Paulus,
give me a good switching&mdash;harder than the one I gave
you." I thought mine had been strong enough; my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
back must have been as red as a boiled lobster. I followed
his injunctions until he said it was enough.</p>

<p>Then more steam was raised after a while, and after
this was done all shouted, "Let us have another
switching before we go." At last I went out with a
few of the men, when, lo! they rolled over two or
three times in the snow, calling out to me to do likewise;
that it felt so good. I did what they bade me to
do. How nice it was! It was a delightful sensation.
Then we got up and ran as fast as we could for our
houses.</p>

<p>As we ran, they called to me, "Paulus, do not dress
at once, and not before you have stopped perspiring."
So I walked up and down in my room for more than
an hour before I dressed. After this I felt like a new
man.</p>

<p>The Finlanders do not dress like the Laplanders
when they are at home; it is only when they travel
that they wear the kapta or pesh. The men wear
long overcoats, lined with woolly sheepskin. The
women's dress is composed of a body of black cloth,
with skirt of thick homespun wool. Their long and
heavy jackets are also lined with sheepskin inside,
and they wear hoods.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>How the Lapps and Finns Travel.&mdash;Strange-looking Sleighs.&mdash;Different
Varieties.&mdash;Lassoing Reindeer.&mdash;Description
of the Reindeer.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AFTER leaving this hamlet where I had such
an odd bath, I came to a farm where I saw
sleighs the like of which I had never seen before.
To many of these were harnessed reindeer with superb
horns, while others were without animals.</p>

<p>These sleighs looked exactly like little tiny boats,
just big enough to carry one person and a very small
amount of luggage, but not big enough for trunks.
They were all made of narrow fir-tree planks, strongly
ribbed inside just like boats, about seven feet long and
two and one-half feet in width at the end, which was
the broadest part. The forward part of some was
decked. They all had a strong leather ring to which
the traces were fastened. They had holes pierced in
their sides for strings to pass through from one side
to the other to keep everything fast. They had keels
like sailing boats; these were very strong and about
four inches wide, and varied some in thickness or
height; many of the keels were much worn from
constant use.</p>

<p>As I was looking at these sleighs, strange-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
people of very small stature came out of the farmhouses.
These were Lapps, and they were dressed
as I was. We saluted each other and began to speak
together in Swedish, and they wondered where I came
from.</p>

<p>One of them said to me, "You are looking at our
sleighs as if you had never seen such ones before."</p>

<p>"You are right," I replied, "I have never seen
such sleighs before, and if these had been on the
shores of a river or lake, I should have taken them to
be boats."</p>

<p>Then the Lapp explained: "The higher the keel
is the quicker the sleigh can go and the faster we can
travel. The keel acts like a runner, and when the
snow is well packed and crisp, the sides of the sleigh
hardly touch it; but this makes it the more difficult
for a beginner to remain inside, for the sleigh rocks
to and fro."</p>

<p>Then pointing to a sleigh, he said, "This kind is
called 'Kerres.' They are used to carry merchandise
or people." Then pointing to another, "This kind
is called a 'Lakkek.'" These were somewhat larger
than the other, and had decks like a vessel, with a sort
of hatchway. These were used as trunks; two had
their decks covered with sealskin to make them more
surely water-tight.</p>

<p>"In these," said the Lapp, "we carry our woollen
clothing, our fine handkerchiefs, our jewelry, our
silver spoons, our prayer-book and psalm-book&mdash;everything
that is precious. In them we also carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
our provisions, our coffee, our sugar, salt, and everything
that has to be protected against snow or
dampness."</p>

<p>Another kind was called "Akja," especially built
for fast travelling, and had keels about two and a half
to three inches thick. The forward part of these was
over-decked to about a third of the length, and
covered with sealskin. The decked part was a sort
of box or trunk to keep provisions or other things
necessary for a journey which required to be protected.
The backs of most of these were leather-cushioned.</p>

<p>After I had looked carefully at all the sleighs, I
went to the farmhouse with the Lapps and was welcomed
by the Finlander who owned the place. His
name was Jon. We were soon friends.</p>

<p>The people asked me whither I was bound, and I told
them that I was going as far north as the Arctic Ocean,
as far as Nordkyn. Then they said to me, "You
cannot go further without learning how to drive reindeer,
for you must give up horses. The snow is too
deep and we do not use dogs in our country. We
will teach you how to drive reindeer and use our
sleighs; then, when you know, some of us will take
you where you want to go, either north, east, or west."</p>

<p>I bought a very pretty sleigh with the forward part
decked over, where some of my things could be
stored. The back was cushioned and covered with
sealskin made fast with broad rounded-top copper
nails. This was a really "swell" sleigh.</p>

<p>The next day Jon said to me, "Let us go together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
where my herd of reindeer is, and lasso those I
want to use, for I am going to teach you myself
how to drive," adding: "I own over one thousand
reindeer."</p>

<p>He called two other Lapps, and we put on our
skees and started, and soon after we were out of sight
of the house. After an hour's travel we reached the
reindeer. I noticed that the snow was not very deep.</p>

<p>"In this herd I have over sixty reindeer that have
been broken to harness," said Jon.</p>

<p>"How can you find them out of such a great
number?" I asked. "To me so many of them look
alike, in fact they would all look alike if it were not
that with some the horns are not as big as those of
the others."</p>

<p>"I know them all," he replied. "I could even tell
the ones that are missing."</p>

<p>Then I remembered that I had heard that a shepherd
knew every sheep of his flock.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said Jon. "Many of the
reindeer are shy, and do not come to us when we are
trying to lasso them."</p>

<p>Jon and the other two Lapps let their skees slip off
their feet, so that they could have a stronger footing,
looked round so as to recognize the deer they wanted,
and then with their lassos in their hands, ready to
be flung, walked very carefully towards two reindeer
somewhat apart from the others. When they
were near enough, some ten or fifteen yards from
them, which is about the distance one can lasso with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a chance of success, they stopped and threw their
lassos over the horns of the animals. One made no
effort to escape, for he had been used to this for more
than five years; but the other cut up any amount of
pranks, though in his efforts to get away the rope got
tighter and tighter at the base of his horns.</p>

<p>The man had to use all his strength before the
animal was subdued. Once or twice he was pulled by
the reindeer and almost fell. In his efforts to get
away the reindeer entangled his legs in the lasso and
fell powerless. In the mean time Jon had come gently
towards his reindeer and knotted the cord of the lasso
round his muzzle.</p>

<p>"We always do this," said he to me, "as a measure
of precaution. When thus corded the reindeer move
with far more difficulty if they wish to run away."</p>

<p>The other reindeer, which fought so desperately for
freedom, had only been used twice during the winter
and was not accustomed to being lassoed.</p>

<p>These two animals were tied to trees, and then Jon
and the Lapps went to capture two others. Jon
missed the second reindeer, a splendid bull, on the
first throw, the lasso falling on his back; but the next
throw caught him. At the same time the other man
had succeeded in lassoing the fourth one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/007.png" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="" />
"The man had to use all his strength."</div>

<p>Then Jon, pointing to the second reindeer he had
lassoed, said: "Paulus, I wanted this one especially
for you. He is thirteen years old. He is one of
my favorites and has been often under harness. He
does not go quite as fast as he did formerly, but he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
just the reindeer for you, for he is more easily managed
than any others I own."</p>

<p>I looked at the reindeer. I noticed that the animal
had much stouter legs than the common deer, or even
than the elk, and the hoofs were particularly large.
They are smaller than our own big elks, and looked
very much like our caribou. The hair of the majority
of the reindeer was gray, very coarse and thick,
and almost white under the belly. Some of the animals
in the herd were white.</p>

<p>Then we went homeward. Two or three times
one of the reindeer made a light show of resistance
and had to be pulled for a minute or so, and the
wilder one was even less easy to manage; he struggled
hard several times, and twice the Lapp who held him
was almost thrown down.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Harnessing Reindeer.&mdash;The First Lessons in Driving.&mdash;Constantly
Upset at First.&mdash;Going Down Hill with Reindeer.&mdash;Thrown
Out at the Bottom.&mdash;Queer Noise
Made by Reindeer Hoofs.</p></div>


<p class="cap">ON our return we tied our reindeer securely and
went to a small house where the harness was
kept. There I saw along the walls many collars,
leather straps, and traces, but no bits. I thought
this was singular, and I wondered how the reindeer
could be driven, but I said nothing. But when harnesses
for the reindeer were brought out I found
that harnessing a reindeer was very unlike harnessing
a horse, and far more simple. A collar was put on,
and at the lower part of the collar a strong plaited
leather trace was fastened. This passed between the
reindeer's legs and was made fast to the forward part
of the sleigh. No bits are used. The rein (there
was only one) was also of plaited leather and fastened
at the base of the horns.</p>

<p>During this process the reindeer seemed very restless
and several times were on the point of running away.</p>

<p>"The harnessing, as you see," said Jon to me,
"though simple, has to be done with great care, for
no matter how well trained a reindeer is, as soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he is harnessed he wants to go; besides, he is easily
scared when in harness." So while things were being
made ready for the start the reindeer were tightly held.</p>

<p>"I will now show you how to take your place in
the sleigh," said Jon. Then he sat upright at the
bottom, with his legs stretched before him and his
back resting against the end of the sleigh. Then he
got out and said, "Now you get in." I found the
position a very uncomfortable one; but this is the
only way one can sit in these little sleighs. And it
took me some time to get accustomed to it without
getting tired, though afterwards I could sit for hours
without getting out.</p>

<p>Jon handed me the rein and twisted it round my
wrist, and said with a rather roguish smile: "Now,
if you upset, the reindeer cannot run away without
you! After a while he will stop when he knows you
are tipped over. You will roll over several times in
the snow before he stops."</p>

<p>"All right," I replied, "there is plenty of snow, no
harm can come to me. My head is safe."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Paulus," he added; "see that your
rein never touches the snow, for if it should get under
the sleigh your arm might become entangled and
your wrist or shoulder be dislocated. If you upset,
let the rein go. If you want the reindeer to stop,
throw the rein to the left. If you want him to go
fast, keep it on the right. Keep your rein always
loose, almost touching the snow. Have a sharp lookout
about this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I myself will ride with my legs outside, my toes
touching the snow to guide my sleigh; but you are a
beginner, and you cannot do so. Never ride with
your legs out, for it is dangerous for a man who is
not accustomed to it to ride that way. Sometimes
accidents happen even among the most expert, and
some Lapps get seriously injured. Here is a stick
to guide your sleigh, and to prevent your reindeer
from going too fast push the stick deep into the snow.
It will not be as good as feet, but it is much better
than nothing.</p>

<p>"I will take the lead, you will follow, and two
Lapps will come behind to watch over you. Do not
mind if you upset often; do not be discouraged; a
beginner has to upset many times before he knows
how to drive a reindeer and keep in his sleigh."</p>

<p>In the mean time our reindeers had become very
restive and they were held with difficulty. Suddenly
Jon gave the order to start.</p>

<p>We started at a furious speed, and my sleigh rocked
to and fro. It was awful. I swayed first one way,
then another. I knew that I could not keep my
equilibrium long without being thrown out, and I was
right. Each reindeer wanted to go faster than the
others; they kept on at a terrible gait. I was shot
out of the sleigh, heels over head, and rolled over and
over in the snow. Finally the animal stopped.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/008.png" width="600" height="386" alt="" title="" />
"I was shot out of the sleigh."</div>

<p>The Lapps behind me came to the rescue. After
brushing the snow from my face I got in again, and
my reindeer started off at a fearful speed, and in less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
than thirty seconds I was once more shot out of my
sleigh. This time the rein slipped from my wrist, as
I had not secured it well enough, and the animal sped
away, leaving me on my back, blinded by the snow.
The Lapps went on their skees after my reindeer,
which in the mean time had stopped, and brought it
back to me.</p>

<p>Then they said to me with a laugh: "Often reindeer
start that way when they feel frisky. To-day is
the right sort of weather for them. The mercury
marks 40 degrees below zero. The starting is the
most difficult part."</p>

<p>I thought so! I got into my sleigh, and the animal
started at a furious speed, and once more I was shot
out of the sleigh. I got up half stunned, covered
with snow. Fortunately I had twisted the rein so
well round my wrist this time that the reindeer could
not run away without me, and he stopped after I had
been dragged a few seconds.</p>

<p>I was not disheartened&mdash;so I kept on driving and
being thrown out. It happened so often that I
began to tire of counting the number of times I upset.
It must have been nearly one hundred times that day.
It had been a very hard day's work for me.</p>

<p>The second day I took more lessons, and began to
learn how to balance myself. It is a knack, and I
began to improve and had fewer upsettings. The
third day I did better. I gradually learned pretty
well how to balance myself on level ground, and did
not upset any more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few days I knew how to drive reindeer on
level ground, and I could guide my sleigh with a stick
as well as a sailor steers his boat with the rudder.</p>

<p>When I had reached this stage of expertness Jon
said to me: "Paulus, now you can drive in a level
country, but soon you will come where there are
many steep hills, and mountains. So you must
learn how to drive down steep hills. This is often
very exciting. The weather is beautiful, and this
afternoon I want you to take your first lesson going
down hill. I have sent men for a fresh set of reindeer;
they will soon be back."</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon the reindeer came out
harnessed, and as we were ready to start, "I will lead,"
said Jon, "you will follow, and another Lapp will
come third. It is far more difficult to go down hill
than to drive on a level surface. You must put your
stick deep into the snow to slacken the speed and
guide your sleigh. Don't be frightened at the speed,
which is very great, and be careful not to be thrown
out when you reach the bottom of the hill; this is the
most difficult part of driving, for the reindeer turn
sharply so as not to have the sleigh strike their legs."
At this remark I thought of my going down hill
on skees. That was hard enough, and I wondered
what would happen to me with the sleigh.</p>

<p>The surface of the country was slightly undulating,
and our reindeer followed each other in good order
and at a short distance from one another.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jon slackened the pace of his reindeer so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that I should overtake him. Then, when within hearing
distance, he called out: "We will soon go down
a steep hill," and he started again.</p>

<p>He had hardly said these words when he was out of
sight. I reached the crest of the hill, then down went
my reindeer at a terrible pace, railway speed in fact, and
as the animal reached the bottom of the hill he made
a sudden sharp curve. For a few seconds my body
swayed from one side to the other, and before I knew
it I was flung headlong out of the sleigh.</p>

<p>This took place in a great deal less time than I can
tell it in. I had been thrown out with great force
against the snow, face forward, and as the snow was
granulated it hurt.</p>

<p>I had learned to be quick. I was in my sleigh in
the twinkling of an eye and followed the track made
by Jon, and we rode quietly on the plain. Soon Jon
stopped and a moment after I joined him.</p>

<p>"Paulus," said he, when I had caught up with him,
"we must try another descent." We ascended the
bank in a zigzag way (I following his track) until we
reached the summit. It was hard work. This hill
was very long and steep. When ready Jon shouted:
"Paulus, look out; we are going to have another descent."
The pace of my reindeer was tremendous
as he went down. The animal seemed to know that
if he did not go fast enough the sleigh would strike
against his legs as he descended the hill. Down we
went; we simply seemed to fly, and as the reindeer
got to the bottom he made the same sharp turn again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the sleigh whirled round with a great jerk, and I was
thrown out head over heels as before.</p>

<p>During the descent, as my animal ran his hind feet
threw particles of granulated snow in my face&mdash;they
were like small stones striking it with great force. It
hurt awfully. After this I was obliged to put on my
mask for protection that day.</p>

<p>Ever since I had begun driving reindeer I had
heard a noise, a sharp sound, as if sticks of wood were
striking against each other, when the animals were trotting
at full speed. It occurred to me to ask what was
the cause of this curious noise. My Lapp replied,
"Every time the hoof of the reindeer touches the snow
it spreads wide apart, broadening in this way and keeping
the animal from sinking too deep in the snow; and
when the foot is lifted, the two sides of the hoof
are brought together again, striking against each other
and making the noise you hear."</p>

<p>I continued to improve every day in going down
hill, and succeeded at last in keeping in by throwing
my body in the opposite direction when the reindeer
made his sharp turn. This difficulty conquered, I
bade Jon a hearty good-bye, thanking him for his
patience in teaching me, and continued my journey.</p>

"At noon I saw the sun's lower rim touching the horizon."</div>

<p>From Rukojarvi I had followed the highroad,
passed the post stations of Korpilombolo with its
church, Sattajarvi, and came to the hamlet of Pajala,
in latitude 67&deg; 10'. The hamlet is situated near the
junction of the Torne river with the Muonio, and had
a church.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>The Last Days of the Sun.&mdash;Beginning of the Long Night.&mdash;A
Mighty Wall of Ice.&mdash;The Long Night's Warning
Voice.&mdash;The Aurora Borealis and its Magnificence.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE day I left Pajala I saw the sun at noon; it
was hardly above the horizon; it had barely
risen and shown itself when it was sunset and it disappeared
under the horizon.</p>

<p>Then came a long snowstorm, and for a wonder
one without a gale. After the snowstorm the sky
suddenly cleared, and at noon I saw the sun's lower
rim touching the horizon. It was of a fiery red.
Then after a while it disappeared.</p>

<p>The next day only the upper half of the sun was
above the horizon at noon, and just as the rim was
ready to sink I fancied I heard the sun say to me:
"To-morrow you will not see me; then you will have
entered 'The Land of the Long Night,' and when you
go further and further north you will be in that land.
Good-bye, good-bye."</p>

<p>Then I thought I heard the "Long Night" say to
me: "For one night of six months I rule at the
North Pole. Then I am most powerful. In the
course of countless years I have frozen the sea and
I have built a wall of ice so thick, and so broad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and so hard, that no vessel will ever be strong enough
to break through, and no man will ever reach the
pole. I guard the approach to the pole and watch
carefully the wall of ice I have built around it. When
the sun drives me away and rules in his turn one day
of six months at the pole (for the whole year is equally
divided between us), he tries with his steady heat to
destroy the wall I have built. On my return I
repair the damage the sun has done and make the
wall as strong as it was before. I send terrific gales
and mighty snowstorms over oceans and lands, and
even far to the south of my dominion, for my power
is so great that it is felt beyond my realm."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then I thought I heard the
sardonic laugh of the "Long Night." I shuddered
when I remembered the words the "Long Night"
had just spoken, and the laugh had in it something
sinister. I fancied I saw the dim figure of a woman
with long flowing hair standing at the pole, looking
towards me. She was the "Long Night." I remembered
the names of the valiant and daring commanders
who had led expeditions towards the North
Pole, and had perished in their endeavors with the
gallant men who had trusted and followed them.</p>

<p>Then I thought of the brave explorers who had
followed in their wake with better fortune, for their
lives had been spared, though they failed to reach the
pole. The wall the "Long Night" had built could
not be passed.</p>

<p>As these thoughts came over me, I exclaimed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"'Long Night,' great and terrible indeed has been
the loss of life among those who have tried to reach
the pole, but the ingenuity of man is great, and in
spite of the ice barrier thou hast built around it we
have not lost hope that man by some device of his
own may yet be able to reach the pole."</p>

<p>After uttering these words I imagined I heard,
again coming from the far north, another laugh of the
"Long Night." It seemed like a laugh of defiance in
response to what I had said.</p>

<p>Near me was a forest of tall fir trees; looking up I
saw the great blue of heaven studded all over with
brilliant stars shining down upon the snow-covered
land where I was.</p>

<p>The next day the sun did not appear. I was now
in "The Land of the Long Night." It was strange
now to see stars all the time, and the moon in the
place of the sun. The great pines and fir trees of
the forest contrasted strongly with the snow of the
land.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared below the horizon, but in
clear days its glow could be seen. I could not tell the
hour of the day, for the stars set and rose in continuous
succession in this kingdom of the "Long Night."
I did not know when it was morning or when it was
evening, but in fine weather the glow over the horizon
told me when it was about noon. It was indeed a
strange land; but the Lapps could tell from the stars
whether it was night or day, for they were accustomed
to gauge time by them according to their height above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the horizon, just as we do at home with the sun. I
had my watch, but could not look at it often, for it
was under my garments.</p>

<p>For many days the land was illuminated for a while
every night by the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights.
Sometimes the aurora seemed to imitate the waves of
the sea and moved like big heavy swells, changing
colors, bluish, white, violet, green, orange. These
colors seemed to blend together. Then the heaving
mass would become gradually intensely red. This
red mass broke into fragments which scattered themselves
all over the blue sky. It gave its reflection
to the snow. It was the end of the aurora or electric
storm. They were never twice alike; they varied
in forms and colors. The auroras are like everything
in creation: on our earth there not two men or
women exactly alike, there are not two leaves alike,
two blades of grass, two trees, two stones alike, neither
two waves, for the sea is ever changing in its ripples.</p>

Repast.&mdash;Coffee and Tobacco Lapp Staples.&mdash;Babies in

<p class="cap">WHEN I had left Pajala I travelled on the
frozen Muonio, passed the stations of Kaunisvaara,
Killangi, and Parkajoki, and came to Muonioniska.
All the hamlets or farms had comfortable
log buildings. Some of the dwelling-houses
were quite large. Wood was not lacking and the
houses were quite warm. Forests of the fir were
abundant.</p>

<p>The sun was now hidden below the horizon. The
snow was getting deeper every hour&mdash;and was about
seven or eight feet deep on a level after being packed.
I was coming to another great "Snow Land." From
Muonioniska I travelled on between the Muonio and
Ouanasjoki rivers. (Joki means river in Finnish.)
I became acquainted with many nomadic Lapps who
wandered with their reindeer over that great snow land&mdash;among
them were two very pleasant men of the
name of Pinta and Wasara, who agreed to travel with
me for a while.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Wasara, the younger, was the son of a very rich
Lapp who owned nearly ten thousand reindeer, and
possessed besides a good bank account.</p>

<p>Pinta was poor, the possessor of only about one hundred
reindeer, which pastured with those of his elder
brother. Pinta was about thirty years old; Wasara
about twenty-five. Both were men of splendid physique;
broad shouldered with very muscular legs and
arms, which were apparently as hard as wood. They
had blue eyes and fair hair. One was four feet eight
inches and a half in height, the other was four feet ten
inches. They were very skilful on skees; in summer
they could make tremendous leaps over rivers and
ditches with the long poles they carried with them,
and could drive the most intractable reindeer, which
are even worse than our broncos.</p>

<p>While travelling, I drove next to the leader, for
reindeer follow each other mechanically in the same
furrow. The leader is the one that has the most
work; but if he follows a furrow, his reindeer gives
him little trouble.</p>

<p>Pinta generally took the lead, I came next, and
Wasara third. Pinta and Wasara had their faithful
dogs with them.</p>

<p>Travelling was fine; the snow was well packed, and
so crisp that the sleighs glided over it lightly. Often
we travelled at the rate of fifteen miles an hour, for
our animals were strong and had not been used for
several days.</p>

<p>How I shouted, for I had such an exuberance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
spirits. I felt so strong and healthy. I wanted to go,
to go onward, to go all the time. Sometimes I felt like
running, like jumping. One could not help it, for it
was the atmosphere that made one feel so. I could
not get tired.</p>

<p>The fine weather, however, lasted but a few days.
Then the sky became gray, there was not a star to be
seen, the wind began to rise, and snow fell. We
could see nothing. Wasara thought we were near the
tent of his father, but we could not see any landmark
to guide us.</p>

<p>The two dogs ran in every direction, to try to scent
people. They seemed to know that we were looking
after the tent of Wasara's father; but each time they
would return looking in the face of their masters
silently, as if to say "We find nothing."</p>

<p>We were somewhat afraid of wolves, but trusted in
the dogs to warn us of their approach. We at last
concluded to stop; we kept the reindeer harnessed
and stood near them. We fixed our hoods carefully
over our faces, put on our masks, and seated ourselves
on the snow. Soon I heard heavy snoring&mdash;Pinta
and Wasara were fast asleep, with their heads
downward and arms crossed on their breasts. The
Lapps sleep often in that way when travelling. But
the weather cleared after three or four hours and
we continued our journey. My two friends then
knew where they were.</p>

<p>After an hour's drive we saw in the midst of the
snow, near a large forest of fir trees, a tent. "Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is the tent of my father," said Wasara, pointing out
the tent to me.</p>

<p>We hurried our reindeer, and as we approached the
place more than a dozen Lapp dogs, wolf-like in
appearance, announced our arrival by their fierce
barking.</p>

<p>Wasara's father came outside of the tent, drove the
dogs away, and told them to be quiet. He recognized
his son and bade us come in.</p>

<p>"What a strange abode these nomadic Lapps
have," I said to myself, as I looked around inside of
the tent. According to Lapp etiquette the left side
of the tent was given to us, soft reindeer skins being
first laid on the top of branches of young birch trees
that were spread on the floor of earth, the snow
having been removed where they had pitched their
tent.</p>

<p>The father took his snuffbox from a small bag and
offered me a pinch of snuff. This ceremony meant
that I was welcome, and I passed the snuffbox to his
son who, in turn, offered a pinch of snuff to Pinta.</p>

<p>I looked with astonishment at the people that were
in the tent, and everything that surrounded me.
These Lapps had blue eyes; their faces, owing to exposure
to the blustering winds, were very red, but the
protected part of the skin was as white as that of the
whitest people. There were a number of women and
men, several young girls and two lads. I was told
that there were two men with the reindeer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/010.png" width="394" height="550" alt="" title="" />
"What a strange abode these nomadic Lapps have!"</div>

<p>The women were all busy; one was weaving shoe-bands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of bright colors, red predominating; another
was just finishing a "kapta," and a third one was putting
a lining of red flannel over the seams upon a tiny pair
of reindeer-skin shoes for a child; the girls were sewing
some undergarments.</p>

<p>Wasara's father's first name was Pehr,&mdash;he was a
fine-looking Lapp, about seventy years old. His
father was living, and was about ninety years old.
The outdoor life agrees with the Lapp. Give me the
plateaus of the Arctic regions for health. There are
plenty of mosquitoes in summer, but no malaria at
any time. Nor is there any sore throat there. I do
not remember, indeed, ever to have heard a person
cough in that country.</p>

<p>The material of the tent was of very coarse woollen
stuff, called "vadmal." The tent was about thirteen
feet in diameter at the ground. Its frame was composed
of poles fitting each other; the wood had
become black from being smoked for years. These
poles are so well knitted together that they can resist
the terrific winds which blow over the land. A cross
pole high up sustained an iron chain, at the end of
which is a hook to hold the kettle and cooking pot.
The coarse woollen stuff which covered the frame was
composed of two pieces that were made fast by
strings. The nature of the vadmal permits the wind
to go gently through. The entrance is by a small
sliding door made of the same material.</p>

<p>Inside, along the lower part of the tent, were boxes
of different shapes and sizes, packages lying on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
top of skins to prevent the wind from blowing in
from the bottom; the outside was protected by snow.</p>

<p>As I glanced around I saw two queer-looking things,
resembling in shape the sabots or wooden shoes of
the peasantry of Europe, only very much larger, hanging
near the sides. I looked in, and to my great astonishment
saw a Lapp baby in each. They were
Lapp cradles, called "katkem" or "komse." They
were made of a single piece of wood and were about
two and a half feet long by fifteen or eighteen inches
wide. In one was such a sweet Lapp baby, a dear
little girl, with her eyes wide open. As I looked at
her she smiled. In the other was a big fat boy, fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Two women went out and collected a lot of snow,
which they put on to melt in a big iron pot hanging over
the fire. This is the way the Lapps have to do to
procure water. When the snow had melted she put
the water in a coffee kettle that had a spout. One of
the women ground coffee in a mill. Then the
ground coffee was put into the kettle and left to boil
for quite a while, the woman watching it, taking
off the pot when it was about to boil over, and then
putting it over the fire again. The third woman was
attending to the cups and saucers. When the coffee
was ready they put in a little bit of salt to give it
flavor, then set the coffee kettle on the ground and
put into it a small piece of dried fishskin to clarify it
and precipitate the grounds at the bottom of the
kettle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When the coffee was ready to be poured, one of the
women went out and came back with reindeer milk
which had remained frozen for over three months.
Then the coffee was served. The wife bit several
pieces of rock candy from a big lump, to sweeten
each cup of coffee, and after putting in frozen reindeer
milk with a spoon, licked it with her tongue&mdash;"What
is the use of being particular when one
travels," I said to myself. If one were, he would
starve. We had silver spoons, round in shape, with
twisted handles. "These," said the father, "have
been in the possession of our family for nearly two
hundred years." I saw different initials and different
dates from the year 1700 down.</p>

<p>After coffee men, women, and the young girls filled
their pipes and had a good smoke. They were very
much astonished when I told them I had never smoked
in my life.</p>

<p>"There are two things we Lapps have always with
us&mdash;coffee and tobacco. After a hard day's work
or a long journey there is nothing so refreshing as
coffee," said Pehr Wasara, smacking his lips at the
very thought.</p>

<p>While we were chatting, Pehr was busy cutting
reindeer meat and putting the pieces in a pot hanging
over the fire which had been filled with snow that
had melted. When he had finished, he said: "By
and by you will have something to eat." I was prodigiously
hungry; travelling over the snow in a temperature
between 35 and 45 degrees below zero, as I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
done for several days, gives one such a good appetite!
While waiting for the meal to be ready, I went outside
the tent with my host.</p>

<p>The sight outside was quite as strange as the inside
of the tent. Numerous Lapp sleighs were scattered
here and there, skees were lying on the ground in
different directions. Quarters and other large pieces
of reindeer meat, out of the reach of wolves, foxes,
and dogs, were suspended to the branches of trees.
On two racks about eight feet high above the ground
were pieces of reindeer meat piled upon each other.
Collars, traces, reins, everything for the harnessing of
reindeer, were seen all round the tent; buckets full
of frozen reindeer milk, filled late in the autumn,
were on the ground. Hanging on trees were bladders
filled with congealed milk or blood.</p>

<p>The sleighs were of different kinds; several were
decked over and used as trunks. Others were empty.
Four were filled with hoofs of the reindeer they had
killed to subsist upon during the winter.</p>

<p>Skins of wolves, of white foxes, of reindeer, were
stretched on frames, so that they could not shrink.
Reindeer pack-saddles, empty pails, wooden vessels,
lay here and there. Fur garments and underwear
were hanging to the branches of trees. It was a
strange sight indeed! But a sight I met thereafter at
almost every camp.</p>

<p>When the meal was ready we were called in. The
host served the meat, which had been put in a large
platter, in portions, guessing what would satisfy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
hunger of each person. The fattest parts, which are
considered the most dainty, were given to me, being
the guest of honor, and the meat was served to us in
wooden plates. We had nothing but reindeer meat.
I was getting accustomed to eat meat without bread or
potatoes.</p>

<p>During the meal small pieces of roots of fir trees,
which are full of resin, were thrown into the fire for
light. After the meal I thanked all for it, according
to the custom. Then the Lapps lighted their pipes
again.</p>

<p>Pehr Wasara employed a man and a woman servant.
From their clothing you could not tell them apart
from the other people. They were treated like members
of the family. The girl was paid three reindeer
a year, the man six.</p>

<p>"How much can you buy a tent for?" I inquired
of Pehr Wasara. "Thirty or forty dollars," he replied.
"This is a great deal of money for us poor
Lapps." Pehr had plenty of money in the bank, but
pretended poverty. I learned also that a trained reindeer
costs eight dollars.</p>

<p>I asked many questions. How long a tent lasted?
He replied: "The vadmal is very durable, and a tent
lasts about twenty years, but it has to be patched very
often during that time." I looked round and saw a
good many patches, and I thought of the story of the
knife and handle,&mdash;first the blade broke, then a new
blade was put in; after this the handle broke, and a
new handle was put on. I remembered that once a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dear old aunt of mine said to me: "Paul, this black
silk dress has lasted me twenty years." I exclaimed,
"Twenty years, aunty! Are you sure of this?"
Then in the course of a few days, by indirect questions
I found out that she had had three new bodices
put on at different times, and three different skirts.
I thought the tent of the Lapp might be twenty years
old in the same way.</p>

<p>After the meal had been finished the babies were
taken from their cradles, and their little beds were
made afresh. The cradle bottoms were covered with
fine, soft, well-dried lichen or reindeer moss, over
which a little cotton sheet was spread. The babies
were stark naked, and were wrapped in little sheepskins
while their beds were being made. Then they were
laid in, the sheet turned down, with a coarse piece of
vadmal and sheepskin over it; the whole was made
fast by a cord fastened through holes on each side of
the cradle and laced across.</p>

<p>One of the mothers said to me: "When a child is
born it is the custom among Lapps to give him or
her a reindeer. When baptized the sponsor, too,
often gives a reindeer to the babe, and these animals,
and the increase thereof, become the child's own
property."</p>

<p>This woman, pointing out her sister to me, observed:
"When my baby had his first teeth, my sister
here presented him with a reindeer. This is a
custom among us Lapps."</p>

<p>Then two of the men and two of the women with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
their dogs and their skees went to relieve the people
who were watching the reindeer herd, and Pehr Wasara
remarked, "My reindeer are divided in a number of
herds&mdash;for they could not all pasture together. We
are afraid of wolves. These people are to remain on
the watch all night."</p>

<p>The family was very pious; they were, like all the
Lapps, Lutherans. Before going to sleep they sang
psalms and hymns, praising God for the blessings of
the day.</p>

<p>Then they dressed themselves for the night, putting
on over the garments they wore during the day
a long reindeer kapta, a sort of nightshirt reaching
below the feet. More reindeer skins were put over
the skins on which we were seated. Then a big bearskin
was given to me as a blanket, Pehr saying, "I
killed this bear myself."</p>

<p>Before retiring I took off my shoes, the Lapp grass,
and my stockings, and hung them on the cross poles
to dry. All did likewise. I carefully arranged my
precious Lapp grass so every vestige of dampness
would be absorbed when I should put it on again
in the morning. One of the women lent me a pair
of her own stockings, which she took from one of the
little chests by her side.</p>

<p>The fire had gradually died out. "We seldom
keep fires burning at night," said the head of the
family, "for it would be dangerous." The dogs
were driven out and the door made secure, comparatively
speaking. We were all huddled close together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Then we bade each other good-night. I looked at
my thermometer, it marked 39 degrees below zero
inside the tent; it was 46 degrees outside and everything
was perfectly still, there was not a breath of air
stirring. Through the opening in the tent for the
smoke to pass, I could see the stars twinkling in the
blue sky as I lay on my back. Then putting my head
under my bearskin I soon fell asleep, though some dogs
succeeded in smuggling themselves in, and two or three
times they awoke me by trying to get under my bearskin
and lie by me. They did likewise with the other
people. Once I was awakened by a big booming
sound. It was the cracking of the ice over a lake not
far off from us.</p>

<div class="head4"><p>Toilet with Snow.&mdash;A Lapp Breakfast.&mdash;Lapp Dogs.&mdash;Talks
with my Lapp Friend about the Reindeer.&mdash;Their Habits and
Various Forms of Usefulness.</p></div>


<p class="cap">WHEN we awoke in the morning it was 40
degrees below zero in the tent and 48 degrees
below outside. I felt like washing my face and my
hands, but melted snow was sure to turn into ice as
soon as it was on my face. I did not want to wash
in warm water, for it would have made my skin too
tender. So I rubbed my face and hands with snow
and dried them thoroughly. This was my usual
morning wash when I slept out of doors.</p>

<p>A big fire was lighted and the maidservant went
to work kneading dough&mdash;yeast was not used. The
loaves were baked on charcoal, as is often done among
the Lapps, and at the same time coffee was made.</p>

<p>The breakfast was composed of the dry powdered
blood of reindeer, mixed with flour, diluted in warm
water and made into pancake. We had a porridge of
dried reindeer's milk that had been stirred in warm
water with a wooden spoon. The milk of the reindeer
is very rich and thick. When it was served
to me, the wife remarked: "This food is very nutritious."
We also had some reindeer meat and finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
up with reindeer cheese and a cup of coffee.
It was a fine breakfast. I ate heartily of everything.
When it is so cold one is always hungry. After the
breakfast, all the household with the exception of the
host and hostess started on their skees for the reindeer
herd, which was to be removed to some other
quarters, for the moss had been more or less eaten and
they were to take them to a place where the snow was
not so deep. The mothers had slung their cradles
with their babies on their shoulders. Each Lapp was
followed by his dog.</p>

<p>About one hour after breakfast the night watch
returned with their dogs. Immediately the wife gave
to each a cup of coffee; then they took their breakfast.
They gave their dogs some of the powdered blood
mixed with flour and warm water. The dogs relished
this greatly. Then they were given the bones, which
they had been watching with glaring eyes. They
went out with them and gnawed them until there was
nothing left of them. Such is generally the meal
given to the dogs every day. Once in a while they
get a small piece of meat, which they swallow voraciously
in a single mouthful.</p>

<p>When the night watch had done eating they went
to sleep; so did their dogs. These Lapp dogs are
thickset. They resemble the Pomeranian breed,
but are larger; their hair is long, very thick, and
bushy. Their ears stand upright; they seem to have
some wolf blood in them. The tail is curly. Pehr
Wasara said to me: "Lapps could not do without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
their dogs. They are faithful animals; they are our
helpmates; they keep our reindeer together when we
are on the march, watch them when they are pasturing;
they look out constantly for wolves, and warn us
when they are in the neighborhood, and of their
approach beforehand, and attack them without fear.
Neither are they afraid of bears. They are very brave.</p>

<p>"Every man, woman, manservant or maidservant
and grown-up child, has his or her dog which obeys
and listens to his master alone. They are never
allowed to stay behind; wherever their master goes
they go, and watch with him night and day if necessary.
Occasionally, for some reason unknown to us, or
because the deer scent the wolves afar off, a panic seizes
the herd of reindeer, and instinctively they move away.
That is the time when our dogs prove most useful and
of the greatest service to us. They go around in every
direction and bring the reindeer together. They seem
to know that there is some unseen danger. When the
wolves come into the herd, the dogs attack them
fiercely and act with great cunning, taking care not to
be bitten by them and waiting for the opportunity to
spring on the wolves."</p>

<p>While Pehr was talking I wished I could see a
pack of wolves attacking reindeer, to see how the dogs
fight them.</p>

<p>"Do not think," added Pehr, "that it is our inclination
to be harsh towards our dogs. We never
overfeed them; it is the only way to keep them hardy,
strong, and healthy. They are not allowed to rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
until their master or mistress has returned to the tent.
Then we want them to stay out doors."</p>

<p>"I should like very much," I said to Pehr, "to
see how you break in reindeer and accustom them to
harness."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "you will see how we train our
reindeer to draw sledges. You came just in time, for
we are now training some, as we have several that are
getting too old. The males are used as draught animals,
as they are stronger than the females. When
the snow is in good condition they can draw as much
as four hundred pounds, or two or three logs of pine
or fir."</p>

<p>So he sent two men after the reindeer. They took
their lassos with them, and in less than an hour they
returned with two reindeer.</p>

<p>"The process of teaching a reindeer to draw a sleigh
or carry a pack on his back," observed Pehr, "is very
tedious and very hard work. Some of the reindeer
are more difficult to teach than others, and in spite of
the best training the wild nature and restlessness of
the animal shows itself not infrequently."</p>

<p>I thought so. I remembered my first lessons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/011.png" width="600" height="386" alt="" title="" />
"I went outside the tent with my host."</div>

<p>"We begin to train the reindeer," he continued,
"when he is about three years old, and he does not
become a well trained animal before he is five. When
they are under training a daily lesson is given them
to let them know their masters, and also a lesson to
accustom them to be lassoed, of which they are very
much afraid at first. We give them salt and angelica,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of which they are very fond, every day, to make them
come when they are needed, and in that case the lasso
is not necessary. They are never subjected to ill-treatment
at any time; if they were we could do
nothing with them."</p>

<p>The work of teaching the reindeer to draw a sleigh
began. Salt was first given to one of the deer, which
he seemed to enjoy very much. Then without trouble
a very strong leather cord with a loop was put carefully
over his horns, and the loop was drawn tight
at the base. The collar was carefully put on his neck
and more salt given to him. The trace attached to the
sleigh was much longer than those used when driving;
it was several yards in length, so that the sleigh could
not be touched when the animal kicked; then it was
tied to the collar of the reindeer. As soon as the
animal was urged to move, and felt the weight of the
sleigh, he plunged wildly forward and kicked, then
plunged first in one direction and then in another. It
was a great sight. I thought they would never be able
to break the animal in. It required all the strength
of the Lapp not to be dragged by the animal. The
other man, with a cord, held the sleigh. After a few
trials both man and beast were exhausted.</p>

<p>A short rest was then taken and another trial was
made. With repeated rests for the trainer and the animal,
the day's lesson proceeded. The trainer was in
profuse perspiration, though it was 38 degrees below
zero. My host said to me: "This exercise is repeated
day after day until the animal submits to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
They are in their prime at seven or eight years and can
work till the age of fifteen or seventeen years. The
reason we have to wander so much with our reindeer
is that we have to go where the snow is not so deep as
in other parts, for the reindeer has to dig into the snow
to find his food, the lichen, and he cannot go deeper
than three or four feet. We generally know where
these places are, for the wind, which blows every year
more or less in the same direction, blows away a part
of the snow. When we come to such a place we pitch
our tent."</p>

<p>"When the reindeer is left to himself can he find
such a place?" I inquired. "How can the animals
know that the snow is only three or four feet deep?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," he replied, "but the wild reindeer
can find it, otherwise they would starve."</p>

<p>"How can they dig through the snow?" I asked
with a smile. "They have no shovels."</p>

<p>Pehr laughed at my remark. "Their fore feet are
their shovels," he replied. "You will see for yourself
how they dig the snow."</p>

<p>I asked Pehr also about the speed of the reindeer.</p>

<p>"The speed of the reindeer," he replied, "varies
very much according to the time of the year and the
state of the snow, October, November and December
being the months when they are the fleetest, as they are
fresh from the summer pastures. January and February
are also very good months for them. The cold
weather strengthens them, and they are not yet exhausted
from digging through the snow, as they are at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the end of the season. The rapidity of their gait depends
very much also on the state of the surface of the
snow. If it is well packed and crisp, they go very fast.
Much depends, too, upon the distance and whether
the country is hilly or not, or with a long range of
slopes. On the rivers, over well packed snow, and a
good track that has been furrowed by previous reindeer,
they can average twelve or fifteen miles an hour
when in good condition, sometimes twenty for the
first hour; down a mountain slope twenty and twenty-five.
They can travel five or six hours without stopping;
the first hour very rapidly, the second more
slowly, and towards the fifth and sixth hours still
more slowly, perhaps not more than eight or ten miles
an hour, for by that time they require rest and food,
and we unharness them in places where the snow is
not deep, and let them get their food. Early in the
winter, when they are in good condition, one can travel
with a swift bull reindeer one hundred and fifty miles
in a day, and even two hundred miles if the condition
of the snow is favorable and the cold is 30 or
40 degrees below zero. The colder the weather is the
greater is the speed. Seventy or eighty miles a day is
a good average for a reindeer."</p>

<p>When this talk was ended, Pehr Wasara said to
me, "Let us take our skees and go to one of my
herds near by." After a run of about two miles we
came into the midst of a herd of about three thousand
reindeer. "There are more," he said with pride.
"Are they not fine animals?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, they are," I replied.</p>

<p>While I was looking at the magnificent horns of
some of the beasts, Pehr remarked: "The horns of
the males, which often weigh forty pounds, attain the
full size at the age of six or seven years, those of the
cow at about four years. The time the reindeer drops
his horns is from March until May. In the adult
animals they attain their full size in September or at
the beginning of October. After the age of eight
years the branches gradually drop off. They are the
easiest animals that man can keep. They require no
barns. They are never housed. They like cold
weather and snow. Food has not to be stored for
them. They will not touch the moss that has been
gathered unless brought up to do so by farmers.
They get their food themselves. We do not give
them water. When thirsty they eat the snow. When
our people go among them they will often not even
raise their heads, and remain quiet when we pitch our
tents. Once in a while there is so much snow in
some districts that it is impossible for reindeer to get
at the moss; then the only way is to go to the lowlands,
or into the forest, where the reindeer can feed
on the moss hanging from the firs or pines.</p>

<p>"Some of the reindeer," he went on, "though
trained to eat kept moss, hay, and even bread, thrive
only when they are free to roam about; they cannot
be kept all the time in their stables. They must wander
over the snow and eat it. Otherwise they are sure
to degenerate and become useless as draught animals."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"How many reindeer," I asked, "does a family
require for its support?"</p>

<p>He replied, "A thousand at least. A herd of two
thousand to two thousand five hundred gives from
two hundred to two hundred and seventy-five, perhaps
three hundred, calves a year. Sometimes we
have bad years with our reindeer. Some years prove
unfavorable to their increase. Some years the snow
is very deep, which prevents them from digging for
food; the herd then become emaciated from their
exertions and want of sufficient food, and many
die.</p>

<p>"Some Lapps," he added, "own five or six thousand
reindeer, one or two among us, eight or ten
thousand. The spring is a bad time for them; the
snow melts during the day from the sun's heat, and
a thick crust forms at night from the frost, so that
their feet break through, causing lameness and
disease. At that time we move them as much as we
can only during the day, but it is hard work for them
to go through the soft snow.</p>

<p>"Without the reindeer we could not exist in this
northern land of snow. The reindeer is our horse,
our beast of burden. On him we feed. He gives
us our clothing, our shoes, our gloves; his skin is
our blanket and our bed; his sinews our thread.
On the march a herd of reindeer is easily managed.
We keep them together without much trouble, and
in winter they remain where we leave them to get
the moss; but if the wolves are after them, then they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
flee in every direction, and many herds then become
mixed together."</p>

<p>"When your reindeer get mixed with those of
other herds, how can you tell which are yours?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>Pehr answered, "Every owner has his own mark
branded on the ears of all his reindeer, and no other
person has the right to use the same, as this is legal
proof of ownership; otherwise, when several herds
were mingled together the separation would be impossible.
The name of the owner of a herd, and each
mark, have to be recorded in court like those of any
owner of property."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Moving Camp.&mdash;Another Great Blizzard.&mdash;A Remarkable
Sight.&mdash;Deer Getting their Food by Digging the Snow.&mdash;How
Reindeer are Butchered.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE next day after our conversation about reindeer
Pehr Wasara said to me: "We are going
to move away our camp and take our reindeer to a
new pasture," an expression that struck me as somewhat
singular, as the country lay under snow to the
depth of five or six feet. "Some of us are going to
fetch the draught animals, and I will be back in a
short time." With these words he left with some of
his people.</p>

<p>They returned with a fine lot of trained reindeer.</p>

<p>In the mean time there had been a great commotion
in the camp; everybody was busy; the tent had been
packed in two bundles; its frame made three packages;
the frozen reindeer milk, all the provisions,
meat, garments, robes, skins,&mdash;in a word, everything
they had was loaded on different sleighs and secured.</p>

<p>The babies were carefully fixed in their queer-looking
cradles, and made quite safe against blustering
winds.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, the reindeer were harnessed
and we started. Soon after, we came to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
herd which had been bunched by the Lapps, the
dogs keeping them together. Then we began our
march.</p>

<p>The herd moved in advance, in a body. Men,
women and children on their skees moved after them
with great rapidity, with their dogs to help them in the
work of keeping the herd together. They all shouted
and urged the dogs to look out, but this required, I
thought, no urging, for the dogs were on the alert and
knew what to do. In the rear were three Lapps with
their dogs driving the reindeer forward; the dogs
barked behind the heels of the animals, and once in a
while would bite the legs of those that did not move
fast enough.</p>

<p>The women worked just as hard as the men, and
those who had babies carried them in their cradles,
slung on their backs, and went as fast on their skees as
if they had been free from burdens. The babies were
evidently very comfortable, for they were very quiet.</p>

<p>It was a fine sight to see the herd of over three
thousand reindeer on the move over the vast plain of
snow. After two hours we arrived at the place of our
encampment.</p>

<p>The Lapps hurried the putting up of the tent.
The snow had been shovelled from the place where it
was to stand. They were laying the birch twigs for a
floor, and skins were put on the top of these; alongside
of the tent inside boxes and firewood were
placed, and outside snow was piled along the sides,
also. This was to prevent the wind coming in. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the mean time the reindeer had been unharnessed and
some of the sleighs unloaded.</p>

<p>Just then Pehr Wasara exclaimed: "Paulus, we are
going to have a great windstorm very soon. That is
the reason we are in so much of a hurry."</p>

<p>He was right. Soon after the wind began to rise
and blew stronger and stronger, hissing and striking
against the tent. In another moment we were in the
midst of a hurricane. I thought every instant that
our tent would be blown away and the woollen canvas
torn to pieces.</p>

<p>The snow was flying thickly in the air. I said to
myself: "If our tent is blown away I will get into
my reindeer bags." I was astonished to see that the
tent could withstand the storm, but the frame was
well knit together, and the woollen vadmal being
porous allowed the wind to pass through and did
not give the resistance that canvas would have done.
If the tent had been made of canvas I am sure the
frame could not have withstood the pressure and fury
of the blast. The door was protected from the
violence of the wind, which struck against the tent on
the other side.</p>

<p>The reindeer had huddled close together and stood
still, except that now and then those which were outside
wanted to go inside and let some of the other
animals bear the brunt of the storm. I noticed that
many of the bulls formed the outer ring, thus protecting
the female reindeer. The poor fellows on the outside
had a hard time of it. All the herd faced the wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the tent, when everybody was in, we were
packed close together, including the dogs. In spite
of all the drawbacks the tent was comfortable compared
with the weather outside. A blazing fire, over
which hung a kettle full of reindeer meat, sent the
smoke into our faces; but we were thinking of the
warm broth and of the good meal we were going to
have, and we laughed merrily and did not care for
the storm. The Lapps knew that the tent would
stand the hurricane. The dogs were in the way of
everybody; the Lapps continually drove them out,
but soon after they were in again.</p>

<p>How nice the broth was when we drank it! How
good the meat tasted! This was a splendid meal.</p>

<p>When it was time to go to sleep I took off my
shoes and stockings, and carefully put the Lapp grass
with the stockings on my breast to dry the moisture,
for the fine snow came through the smoke hole.
Then I got into my two bags and said good-night to
the family.</p>

<p>I was bothered by the dogs during the night.
They were no sooner driven out than they would
come in to huddle with the people. One tried to
come into my bag and awoke me. I did not blame
the poor dogs, for it was far more comfortable inside
than outside. When I awoke in the morning the
weather was fine, there was no wind, and some of the
Lapps took the reindeer to their new pasture.</p>

<p>After breakfast, my host and I drove to see some
of his friends who had pitched their tent some forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
or fifty miles from us. On our way we entered a
large forest of fir trees, and soon after found ourselves
in the midst of a number of deep holes dug by reindeer
in order to reach the moss. We also saw
furrows made by Lapp sleighs and tracks of skees.
The holes increased in number as we got deeper into
the forest, and driving instead of being a pleasure
became a hard task. There was no mistake about
that. Our little sleighs pitched forward, then side-wise,
and rolled on one side or the other. I had the
hardest work to keep inside. At last I was pitched
into one of the holes with my sleigh almost on top of
me. This was no joke. Fortunately I had undone
the twist of my rein round my wrist, for I did not
wish to be dragged against a tree in case I did upset.
I was soon in my sleigh again, however, and before
long Pehr Wasara said: "We shall come to the
tent of my friend very soon." He had hardly uttered
these words when we heard the fierce barking of dogs
announcing our arrival. Soon after we found ourselves
before a tent.</p>

<p>These dogs were strange looking, a breed I had
never seen; they had the dark color of the brown
bear, and were without tails. A man came out to
silence them. He was the owner of the tent, the
friend of Pehr Wasara. He bade us in, we were
made welcome, and the snuffbox was passed around.
Coffee was made and served to us with true Lapp
hospitality, but to my taste it was seasoned with a little
too much salt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a grand time. A big kettle filled with
reindeer meat was cooked, and Pehr Wasara told
his friend all the news, and how his son had come
with me to see him. The place of honor was
given to us in the tent; we slept well, under a lot of
skins, and the next morning after breakfast we bade
our host and his family good-bye.</p>

<p>We had not been gone long when I saw something
very strange ahead. An exclamation escaped from
me. I stopped. I thought I saw the ground covered
with hares. I could see them moving. "What are
such great numbers of hares doing here?" I said to
myself. They moved in such a strange manner;
they seemed to jump, or rather leap. Suddenly I
saw my mistake. "These are not hares," I exclaimed;
"but the tails of reindeer just above the
snow. That is all I see of their bodies. The rest
is hidden. They have dug the snow and are eating
the moss, and their tails are in motion." I had never
seen such a sight before. It was a queer landscape;
over two thousand tails shaking above the snow at
about the same time. This herd also belonged to
Pehr Wasara, who was smiling all over when he saw
how amazed I was at this sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/012.png" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="" />
"They were really working hard for their living."</div>

<p>Then we continued our journey, and soon found
ourselves in the midst of hundreds and hundreds of
reindeer of all sizes. They were just beginning to dig
the snow with their fore legs. How strange was the
sight! As we passed among them they were not in
the least afraid of us. They were left to themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
There were no dogs with them, and no people to
watch.</p>

<p>Every reindeer was working as hard as he could,
busily digging in the snow. They were evidently
hungry. I said to Pehr Wasara: "Let us stay here a
while; I want to watch the reindeer working." Pehr,
who had been accustomed to see reindeer all his life,
wondered at my curiosity, which seemed rather to
amuse him. They dug with the right fore foot, then
with the left, rested at times, then worked again. It
was hard work indeed, but the holes got larger and
larger. The bodies gradually disappeared in the
holes they made, and were partly hidden by the little
mounds of snow coming from these holes, until only
the tails of many could be seen. They had reached
the moss of which they were so fond. They were
really working hard for their living.</p>

<p>Some of the female reindeer were working with
a will, while the young does were looking on, and
when the moss had been reached the mothers called
the calves by a peculiar grunt and let them feed by
their side.</p>

<p>After looking at the reindeer for a while, we continued
our journey and were completely lost in the
midst of deep holes made by the thousands of reindeer.
Wherever we turned we discovered holes and
mounds, until we came to fresh furrows of sleighs and
knew that these led to an encampment. We had succeeded
in getting out of the honeycombed track into
a smooth and open region.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once I noticed that Pehr Wasara was going
much faster than I did. I was losing ground. His
reindeer seemed now to fly over the snow. Suddenly
he disappeared; he was going down a hill. Now it
was the turn of my reindeer to go fast. I prepared
myself for the occasion, for I did not know how steep
was the descent. I said to myself, "Paul, you must
not upset; bend your body on the opposite side
when the sleigh makes the curve, and be quick when
the time arrives. Do this in the nick of time."</p>

<p>Down I went. The animal reached the bottom,
and before I knew it made a sharp curve to prevent
the sleigh striking his legs. I gave a shout of joy.
I had not upset. I felt quite proud.</p>

<p>At the next hill I was more proud than ever, for
Pehr Wasara upset and I did not, but I had never
seen a Lapp get quicker into a sleigh than he did.
Further on Pehr stopped and waited for me. When
I came to him I found myself on the edge of a long
and very abrupt hill, and he said: "This hill is too
steep, we must descend it in long zigzags, so that the
sleighs may not strike the legs of our reindeer, for if
we do not do this the sleigh will go faster than the
reindeer. Follow in my track, and use your stick
with skill to guide the sleigh. Your reindeer will
follow mine without trouble."</p>

<p>Hill after hill was ascended and descended. Now
I had got the knack. At every sharp curve I managed
to bend my body out on the other side in time,
and thus avoided being thrown out. Then we came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to a forest of large fir trees, which surprised me, for
we were in 69 degrees latitude.</p>

<p>The trees were very thick. Pehr Wasara alighted
and led his reindeer, for fear of striking against them,
and I did likewise. It was a relief to move one's
legs, for it is very tiresome to sit for hours with legs
stretched out. Afterwards we got again into our
sleighs, and at the end of a pleasant drive we reached
our own tent and I was received with a hearty welcome
by the family.</p>

<p>The next day Pehr said to me, "We are going to
kill some reindeer this morning, for the skins of the
animals are at their best now and their fur is very
thick. We want clothing, shoes, and gloves. With
their sinews we will make our thread. We want also
new reins, new traces, new lassos."</p>

<p>In the afternoon eight reindeer were brought before
the tent. These were to be slaughtered. My host
said to me: "Paulus, we are going to show you how
we slaughter our reindeer." An old bull was brought
forward and one of the Lapps seized the animal by the
antlers, and by a peculiar twist, without apparently
great effort, threw him on his back. Then he thrust
a long, sharp, narrow knife deeply between his forelegs
until it pierced the heart, where he let it remain.
The poor creature rose dazed, turned round upon
himself twice, then tottered and fell dead.</p>

<p>I did not like the sight, but I was studying the life
of the Laplanders and I had to see everything for
myself. After the blood had accumulated in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
cavity of the chest it was removed and put into a
bladder. The intestines were taken out and washed.
The skin belonging to the forehead between the eyes,
and from the knees to the hoofs, was cut off from the
rest of the hide.</p>

<p>"This," said Pehr Wasara, "will be for shoes and
gloves;" and each piece was stretched on wooden
frames, likewise the skin of the carcass. The tongues
were set aside, the host saying to me, "If it were
summer we would smoke them." The sinews were
collected for thread.</p>

<p>The other reindeer were then butchered, and the
meat placed on the racks outside of the tent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Watching for the Reappearance of the Sun.&mdash;The Upper
Rim First Visible.&mdash;The Whole Orb Seen from a Hill.&mdash;Days
of Sunshine Ahead.</p></div>


<p class="cap">I WATCHED the horizon every day towards
noon, hoping to see the sun, for the light was
getting brighter and brighter. The glow of the hidden
sun was so great at noon that it looked as if
sunrise were going to take place. How disappointed
I felt when the glow became less and less, as the unseen
sun sank lower without showing itself. Then
came to my mind the coast of New Jersey, where in
the early morning I had often watched for the appearance
of the sun above the horizon, in the long
glow that preceded sunrise.</p>

<p>One day I saw a golden thread above the snowy
horizon. It was the upper rim of the sun. I watched,
hoping to see the whole sun. But it was at its meridian,
and in a very short time the golden thread had
disappeared and the sun was on its downward course.
I shouted, "Dear Sun, how much I should like to
see you. I am so tired of beholding only the stars
and the moon. I am longing for sunshine."</p>

<p>Near by was a hill. A sudden thought came into
my mind. I said to myself, "If I ascend this hill I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
shall see the whole sun, as the greater height will
make up for the curvature of the earth."</p>

<p>I ran, and soon was ascending the hill. After a
while I stopped, turned round, and looked where I
had seen the golden thread. I saw about half the
sun. I climbed higher as fast as I could, and when
I reached the top of the hill I saw the whole sun. I
shouted, "Dear Sun, I love you. I love sunshine.
Come and reign once more on this part of the earth.
Come and cheer me, and drive away the 'Long
Night.'"</p>

<p>I watched the sun until it disappeared. Oh! I
wished the hill had been higher so that I could have
ascended it and kept seeing the sun.</p>

<p>When I came to the bottom of the hill I said, "I
do not wonder that in ancient times there were people
who worshipped the sun, for without the sun we could
not exist on the earth, for nothing would grow."</p>

<p>I felt like a new being, for I had seen the sun and
its sight had filled me with joy. Days of sunshine
were coming, and I gave three cheers with a tiger for
the sun.</p>

<p>I had had enough of the "Long Night." I wanted
to see a sky without stars and also the pale moon during
the day.</p>

<p>The following day the glow above the horizon became
more brilliant, and towards noon the sun rose
slowly above the snow; but only about half of its
body made its appearance. It was of a fiery red.
Then it gradually sank. The third day the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the sun appeared above the horizon, then in a
short time sank below. As it disappeared I imagined
the sun saying to me: "Day after day I will rise
higher and higher in the sky and shine a longer time.
I bring with me joy and happiness. I will gradually
transform 'The Land of the Long Night' into a land
of sunshine and brightness. I will bring the spring;
with me flowers will appear, the trees will be adorned
with leaves, grass will grow, the land will be green; I
will make gentle winds to blow, the rivers will be free
and roll their crystal waters, the birds will come and
sing. Man will be happy and gather the harvest that
grows under my rays and husband it for the days of
winter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Wolves the Great Foe of the Lapps.&mdash;How the Reindeer are
Protected against Them.&mdash;Watching for the Treacherous
Brutes.&mdash;Stories of their Sagacity.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AFTER the reappearance of the sun I came to a
region where the Lapps among whom I lived
were in great fear of wolves, for three packs of them
had made their appearance in the forests about one
hundred and fifty miles away to the eastward, and
the news had come to the people.</p>

<p>One day as I was in the tent watching the meal that
was being cooked, one of the Lapps said to me, "We
dread the wolves. No animal is as cunning as a wolf
when he is hungry, and the Chief of the Pack is
chosen by them as their leader because he is the most
cunning of them all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean," I asked, "by the Chief of
the Pack being chosen?"</p>

<p>He replied, "The wolves are very intelligent, and
they choose their leader just as people do. They
select the one among them that can lead them where
there is prey."</p>

<p>Then he added, with a tone of sadness in his voice:
"Our life is one of constant vigilance, and old and
young are continually on the lookout for wolves. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have not suffered from them for three years, but they
may appear suddenly at any moment when we think
they are far away. When wolves attack our herds the
reindeer scatter in great fright in every direction to
long distances, and we have very hard work in bringing
them together again. When they have once been
attacked by the wolves they become very suspicious,
and take fright easily, and at the least alarm run away.
After their flight they roam in small bodies without
any one to watch over them, or dogs to look out for
their enemies, and they become an easy prey to the
wolves. Sometimes the herd is destroyed, and the
rich Lapp becomes suddenly poor. Yes," he added
with flashing eyes, and in a loud tone, "the wolves are
our greatest enemies. We kill them whenever we can."</p>

<p>He remained thoughtful for a little while and then
proceeded: "Reindeer bulls have more fight in them
than the females, and sometimes fight successfully one
wolf; but what can they do against a pack of them?
Our life is a hard one indeed when wolves are around,
for we have to be constantly on the watch night and
day. The wolves are so wary that they always approach
a reindeer or a herd of them when the wind
blows from the herd towards them, so that neither
dogs nor reindeer can scent them."</p>

<p>"I hope," I said to myself, "that I shall see bull
reindeer fight some of these treacherous wolves and
get the better of them; besides I will make them
taste my buckshot, and kill them before the poor reindeer
is overpowered."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>After this conversation we went on our skees to
scour the country for wolves, but there were none to
be seen, and we returned in time for our dinner.</p>

<p>The following day, as we stood in front of our tent
watching the sun above the horizon, we saw in the
distance a black speck coming over the snow. We
watched! What could it be? The speck came nearer,
and we recognized a woman with a bludgeon coming
towards us as fast as her skees could carry her. As
soon as she was within hearing distance she shouted,
"Wolves! Wolves!" The dreaded news had come;
the wolves had made their appearance in our district.</p>

<p>She stopped when she reached us, and with one
voice the Lapps asked her when the wolves had been
seen, and if they had attacked any herd. "No," she
answered, "but they will soon do so, for the tracks of
three packs have been seen." She had hardly spoken
these words when she bade us good-bye, and was on
her way to some of her family who had pitched their
tent about four miles from where we were. The bludgeon
she carried for defence against the wolves.</p>

<p>Soon every man, woman, and child of our tent were
on their skees. The men armed themselves with heavy
bludgeons and guns and, followed by all the dogs, we
started for the herd, taking a lot of reindeer meat with
us. Now there was to be an increased watch day and
night.</p>

<p>I followed the Lapps on my skees, and though I
lagged behind, as I could not go as fast as they did,
one of the girls remained with me to show me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
way, and now and then she would stop and scan the
country for wolves.</p>

<p>I was armed with my double-barrelled shotgun
loaded with buckshot. "Oh, if I could encounter the
wolves," I said to myself, "what havoc I would
make amongst them."</p>

<p>When we came to the herd we told those who
were on the watch the news of the appearance of
wolves. Immediately preparations were made to discover
their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Some of the people went in different directions to
reconnoitre, all armed with their heavy bludgeons.
They shouted as they left: "We will show the wolves
if we meet and chase them on our skees what our
bludgeons can do. We will smash their heads and
break their legs."</p>

<p>Towards dark, when they returned, they had seen no
wolves nor their tracks. "The wolves are so cunning
and their ways are so unknown to us that we must
be on the lookout all night," said the Lapps to me.</p>

<p>Then we partook of our reindeer meat, which had
been kept between our clothing and our chests to prevent
it from freezing. It is not pleasant to eat a
frozen piece of meat as hard as a rock. But I had
learned not to be so very particular. Otherwise I
should never have been able to travel in the country.</p>

<p>The moon was on the wane. When it rose it cast
its dim light upon the snow. It was a very busy
night for the Lapps, for the reindeer had to be kept
together and required constant watching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The dogs acted with great intelligence; they seemed
to know that their masters dreaded the wolves; they
barked continually, and looked once in a while into
the distance, moving away, as if to see if they could
scent the wolves afar off.</p>

<p>I walked with my skees slowly, looking off into
the distance! Suddenly I thought I saw far away
a pack of them. I drew the attention of the Lapp
who was with me to the spot; but his eyes, accustomed
to scan the snow, soon discovered what it was.
He said to me: "There are no wolves there; only
the top of some branches of birch trees above the
snow."</p>

<p>All the Laplanders, men, women, and big boys and
girls, remained on their skees all night. The men
were outside and made a circle round the herd. The
second circle was made by the women; the third
circle, the nearest to the reindeer, by the children.
All shouted and yelled. I yelled also&mdash;I thought it
was great fun! The dogs barked as they followed
their masters or mistresses, going outside of the ring
to look for wolves. They were constantly urged;
but little urging was required, for almost all of them
knew from past experience that it meant that the herd
had to be protected from wolves, for they had seen
them come when their masters were acting precisely
as we were doing, and they were ready for the fray.</p>

<p>If it had been a dark night, or if it had been snowing,
we should have been in a bad plight; but the
moon was our friend. The night passed away and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the wolves had not made their appearance. When
daylight came we were all pretty tired, and we moved
the reindeer nearer to the tent. Then after the coffee
was made and drunk, and some reindeer meat had
been eaten, we all huddled the best way we could
into the tent, covered ourselves with skins, and soon
after fell asleep, leaving the care of the reindeer to
those who were on the watch and to the dogs&mdash;their
untiring and faithful friends.</p>

<p>When I awoke, three dogs were fast asleep near
me&mdash;the dear dogs required rest as well as ourselves;
they had worked hard for their masters all night.
I remembered the time we had had during the night,
and said to myself, "Hard, indeed, is the life of
the Laplander." The reindeer lay on the snow.
After breakfast they were taken a short distance to
pasture, and those who had slept watched them, ready
to fight the wolves if they came.</p>

<p>The news had spread quickly among the Lapps in
the district that wolves might make their appearance
at any moment, and several families with their tents
came to camp near us and their herds were kept near
ours for mutual protection. We were numerous
enough to fight a great number of hungry wolves,
and the country was scoured in every direction.</p>

<p>Numbers of juniper-brush fires were lighted at
night where we had cleared away the snow to scare
off the wolves.</p>

<p>That evening the Lapps told wolf stories. One
began thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"When wolves have lost the Chief of the Pack,
they hold a council and name another Chief, who
they expect will lead them safely through their wanderings
and direct them when an attack is to be made.
The wolves understand each other perfectly well, and
they obey the Chief of the Pack. They often speak
to each other with their eyes. This appears wonderful,
but it is so. But woe to the Chief when the
wolves become dissatisfied with him. When they
find that under his leadership they are constantly
starving, they agree among themselves to destroy
him. They then pounce upon him, kill him, and
devour him. They have a way of agreeing to do
this without their Chief knowing what is to happen to
him. They pass judgment upon him and sentence
him to die."</p>

<p>"Wonderful indeed," I said, "is the intelligence
of the wolves, if what you say is true."</p>

<p>"It is true," said the narrator, and the rest with
one voice confirmed him. "Wolves are as knowing
as people, and we know some of their cunning ways.
The Chief of the Pack must often lead the wolves
on long marches, through forests and unbeaten tracks,
over the snow to some place where he supposes
they will find prey. Besides he must not lead them
into ambush where they may be destroyed. The
Chief must be not only cunning, but brave also. We
see them often, after they have discovered us, going
away or taking another direction than the one in which
they were going. It is simply to deceive us, to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
us believe that they are going away. Then they
make a long detour and take our reindeer in our rear.
People say foxes are cunning, but the cunning of a fox
is nothing to compare to the cunning of a wolf."</p>

<p>"That is so," repeated all the Lapps.</p>

<p>Another man said: "When the Chief of the Pack
becomes old, and is not able to lead the wolves any
more, the wolves kill him and eat him. When two
packs meet there is often a great fight between the
two chiefs for the mastery, and the defeated one runs
away. Then his own pack over which he ruled runs
after him and kills him. Then they proclaim the
victor the new Chief and the two packs join forces.
Often, when the wolves make an attack, the Chief
looks on with a few of his followers as a reserve to
see how things are going, and then rushes in with
them to insure victory."</p>

<p>After this story the Lapps lighted their pipes and
puffed away. Then one passed his snuffbox round,
each taking a pinch of snuff. I took one, and I had
immediately a fit of sneezing that lasted quite a while,
to the great amusement of my Lapp friends. One
of the latter then told the following story:</p>

<p>"Some winters ago, while a number of us were on
skees on our way to church, which was about one hundred
miles away, we saw in the distance quite a
number of wolves, following the Chief of the Pack.
He was easily recognized, not only because he seemed
larger than the others, but because he was always in
the lead, and when he stopped they did likewise. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was fortunate that we were on skees instead of in
sleighs, for the reindeer would have become unmanageable
in their fright and would certainly have been attacked
by the wolves. We were armed with our
bludgeons, and three of us had guns. The wolves,
which had seen us, came in our direction and when at
about a quarter of a mile from us stopped and suddenly
held a consultation, then advanced again towards us.
When they had come within shooting distance I aimed
with my gun at the Chief of the Pack, who stood by
himself, and killed him. Immediately the other wolves
precipitated themselves upon him and fought over his
body and devoured him. In the mean time we shot
two others. Those likewise were devoured by their
comrades. It did not take the wolves much time to
devour their three companions. It was done in the
twinkling of an eye. The wolves were so voracious
because they had not eaten for several days. This
is the time when they follow men and sometimes
attack them when they are a large pack together.</p>

<p>"The other wolves made off, cowed by the death of
their three comrades, but soon stopped and held a consultation
among themselves again, and soon we saw
one among them take the lead. This was the new
Chief of the Pack that had been chosen by them.
Then they walked towards us again, and we were
ready to meet them on our skees. Our object was
to kill this new Chief of the Pack. I aimed at him
and succeeded in killing him also. He had hardly
fallen when he was set upon and devoured. Now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
appetite of the wolves was more or less satisfied, and
after we had killed another they fled as they saw him
fall; once in a while they looked back towards us, but
having no chief they did not know what to do until
they had chosen another&mdash;and they disappeared in
the distance."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>In Search of Wolves.&mdash;A Large Pack.&mdash;They Hold a Consultation.&mdash;Their
Fierce Attack on the Reindeer.&mdash;Pursuing
Them on Skees.&mdash;Killing the Chief of the
Pack.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE following day a great snowstorm swept over
the land, and during that time the Lapps were
much in fear that prowling wolves would get into the
midst of their herds and that we should be unable to
see them on account of the storm.</p>

<p>When the snowstorm was over, the Lapps said to
me: "We are going to scour the country for miles
around and look out for wolves, for now is a good time
to hunt them because the snow is soft. They sink
into it as they run, and we can go much faster than they
do on our skees, and so overtake them and fell them
with our bludgeons." And they asked if I would
accompany them.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, without hesitation, and added,
"I hope we shall meet wolves."</p>

<p>The Lapps left by twos and threes and went in
different directions. One of them and myself took
our way directly east.</p>

<p>After travelling a few miles I espied a black speck
very far away, for I am long-sighted. This at first I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thought to be the top of birch trees above the snow,
as before; but I was not quite sure, and as I walked
along on my skees I kept a sharp lookout. Suddenly
I thought the black spot was moving. I stopped and
watched. There was no mistake, the spot was moving.
It was a large pack of wolves. And they were
apparently coming towards us. I called to my companion,
and pointing to the spot said to him: "Look
there. I think I see wolves." He looked for a while,
then with glittering eyes he said, "Paulus, you are
right; they are wolves."</p>

<p>We stood still to watch them. The spot was getting
bigger and bigger as the wolves came nearer.
They made a large pack; but they were still too far
away for us to be able to guess how many there
were. I wondered if they were coming to attack us.
They certainly would if they had had no food for
several days, for hunger makes them very bold and
fierce.</p>

<p>I looked at my gun. It was all right. My pouch
was filled with buckshot cartridges. My hunting
knife hung by my side. My Lapp held his bludgeon
tightly in his hands. No wolf could run as fast as he
could when he was on his skees, and he could run
away from them if he was not equal to the contest
and if there were too many after him.</p>

<p>"The wolves have perhaps scented the reindeer,"
said he; "they have to come in our direction to
reach the herds."</p>

<p>Not far from where we stood was a big boulder that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was not entirely buried in the snow. "Let us hide
behind it, and watch," said my companion.</p>

<p>After we had come to the boulder, the Lapp hid at
one end of it, I at the other. From our hiding-place
we could peep out and keep a sharp lookout on the
wolves.</p>

<p>The wolves were coming nearer and nearer. I
tried to count them, and I thought there were about
thirty. I soon recognized the Chief of the Pack.
He was bigger and appeared darker than the rest.
He was walking quite ahead of all the pack. They
seemed to become more cautious as they neared us.
What was the reason? We held a consultation.
The Lapp said, "The wind has shifted and is blowing
from the wolves towards us, so they cannot scent us,
and it is by mere chance they are coming in this direction.
They have evidently come from the great
Finland forest east of us."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Chief of the Pack stopped, and all
the wolves stopped also. Then he advanced alone
slowly while the remainder of the pack stood still.
Then the wolves came to join him. They were now
evidently holding a consultation, talking wolf fashion
among themselves, or listening to their Chief, who
had something to say. "What are the wolves up to?"
I inquired of the Lapp.</p>

<p>"They are planning some mischief," he replied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/013.png" width="600" height="382" alt="" title="" />
"The Lapp passed him like a flash and gave him a terrible blow."</div>

<p>Then they divided themselves into two packs, the
old Chief having the greater number of wolves with
him. The new pack with its Chief turned to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
right, the ones with the old Chief remaining at the
same place. I said to the Lapp, "How strange is the
wolves' behavior! Apparently the long conversation
they had among themselves was to arrange a plan of
campaign and to divide themselves into two packs."</p>

<p>"That is so," replied he. "Wolves are very
knowing, and by their tactics fool us very often."</p>

<p>I replied, "We will try to fool them this time,
and kill many of them. The reindeer must be
protected."</p>

<p>"I believe," continued the Lapp, "that the new
pack that has left is going to take our reindeer in the
rear and attack them, and those which remain here
are going to wait for this attack. The reindeer in
their fright will run in the opposite direction and fall
into the midst of these wolves that we see, and which
are waiting for them. The cunning of wolves is
wonderful. When a pack attacks a herd of reindeer
there are always some of them lying in wait somewhere
else.</p>

<p>"You stay here and watch. I must go and warn
our people that the wolves have come among us.
We have been expecting them every hour. It is very
seldom when their tracks are seen that they do not
attack our reindeer. I will return very soon."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. I had plenty of buckshot,
and with my back to the boulder I was not afraid of
being attacked in the rear, and I could face them
without fear, fire at them, and kill a number of them.</p>

<p>After the Lapp had gone I watched the pack carefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The wolves stood still for a long time. They
were looking in a certain direction. I tried to find
what they were looking at, but saw nothing. Suddenly
they advanced, turning away slightly from the
boulder, then walked faster, headed by the Chief of
the Pack. There seemed to be great excitement
among them. I looked in the direction whither they
were moving, when I saw a lot of reindeer coming
towards them, pursued by wolves from behind and
Lapps and dogs following them. What the Lapp
had said had come to pass; the wolves had attacked
the reindeer in the rear, and the pack that had stood
still was ready for the fray and to attack them in
front. I was also prepared for the fight&mdash;ready to
kill all the wolves I could.</p>

<p>Now I saw reindeer in every direction&mdash;wolves
among them, and the Lapps everywhere, moving at
great speed on their skees. They seemed to fly over
the snow. Suddenly I saw one coming near a wolf
which was running after a reindeer, and passing by
his side give with his bludgeon a blow that broke the
back of the beast, which gave a fearful howl. In the
mean time the Lapp wheeled round, came back, and
finished him by a blow on the head.</p>

<p>I saw further on a poor reindeer in his death struggle
with two wolves that had fastened upon his neck.
Two Lapps had seen this also, and armed with their
bludgeons they came at full speed, and as quick as
the flight of an arrow they passed on each side of the
poor reindeer and broke the fore legs of the wolves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which fell on their backs howling. The Lapps
wheeled round, returned and gave them two terrific
blows on their heads, which stunned them; then they
killed them. I had heard the sound of the blows.</p>

<p>The wolves had become very fierce in their attacks.
I wanted to pursue them on my skees, but unfortunately
I was not skilful enough to do so. The reindeer
were fleeing, pursued by the wolves which were
in their midst. It was a fight for life. I saw four
wolves attacking a bull while he was charging one of
them and had almost pierced him with his antlers.
The three other wolves sprang upon him, their big
teeth in his flesh. He ran with them for a while,
then the noble animal fell.</p>

<p>Another wolf came near me and succeeded in bringing
down a young reindeer that was running away
with all his might. I sent a lot of buckshot through
him and killed him on the spot, but I was too late to
save the life of the poor reindeer; and in an instant
the dying wolf was attacked by his voracious comrades,
which precipitated themselves upon him and tore him
to pieces and devoured him. I looked at this scene
with so much astonishment that I forgot to fire
another shot at the wolves.</p>

<p>Several wolves were killed, and at last all were put
to flight. Our victory was complete. I recognized
the Chief of the Pack among the slain. What a big
fellow he was! What ugly-looking teeth he had!
The wolves after this attack were completely disorganized,
and fled in different directions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time my Lapp, true to his word, had
rejoined me. He said: "These wolves understand
each other, and have agreed among themselves to
meet somewhere in the great forest east of us. They
will visit us again in small packs, so we must be on
the watch constantly." Then with a sigh he said:
"Now we are going to have a hard time to bring the
reindeer of each owner together."</p>

<p>The day after the slaying of the wolves, I bade
good-bye to the Lapps and once more started to
wander over the great snowy waste of "The Land of
the Long Night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Great Skill of the Lapps with Their Skees.&mdash;Leaping over
Wide Gullies and Rivers.&mdash;Prodigious Length of Their
Leaps.&mdash;Accuracy of Their Coasting.&mdash;I Start Them
by Waving the American Flag.</p></div>


<p class="cap">I WAS once more travelling westward, and two
days afterward fell in with another company of
nomadic Lapps. We became, as usual, good friends.</p>

<p>One day they said to me: "Paulus, the snow is
in a very fine condition for skeeing, and we are going
to have some fun among ourselves, and run down
steep hills on our skees and try our skill in making
leaps in the air across a chasm there is over yonder,
with a river beyond, and find out who can make the
longest leap and be the champion. We want you to
come with us, for there will be great fun."</p>

<p>I replied, "I am certainly coming, for I have never
seen such a game before, and I like fun. Yes, boys, I
like fun." They laughed heartily when they heard
me say this.</p>

<p>We made ready, and started on our skees, and after
a run of about four miles the Lapps stopped near
the edge of a long and very steep hill, at the foot of
which was a plain.</p>

<p>There they said to me: "There is a wide gully,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
which you cannot see, before reaching the bottom of
the hill, and further down is a river. We will go
down this hill and leap over both the gully and the
river on our skees. Of course, the greater our speed,
the longer the leap we make. The danger is in not
being able to reach the ledge on the other side; but
this makes the fun more exciting. It is very seldom,
however, that accidents happen, for no one undertakes
these dangerous leaps unless he is very sure of
himself."</p>

<p>"What happens then," I asked, "if the leap falls
short?"</p>

<p>"Then," he answered, "you may break your leg, or
arm, or your neck; but I do not know of any such
misfortunes happening, though we hear once in a
great while in the mountains of an accident which
results in death. One of the great dangers in skeeing
is that of striking a boulder hidden under the crust of
snow, or of falling over an unseen precipice. When
we are small children we learn to leap forward in the air
and come down on our skees, beginning by making
small leaps from insignificant heights, increasing the
leap gradually as we have more practice, and so becoming
stronger and more agile and skilful in going
down a hill."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Lapps took up their position along
the brink of the hill and stood in a straight line
about ten or fifteen yards from each other. It was a
fine sight. At a given signal they started on their
skees, holding in one hand their sticks to be used as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
rudders to guide them. They slid down at tremendous
speed; suddenly I saw them fly through the air,
and then land below on their skees. They had leaped
over the gully. Then they continued their course
faster than before, on account of the momentum of the
leap, and as they reached the bottom of the hill they
made another leap in the air, which took them over
the river to the plain beyond. After going a little
further, for they could not stop at once, they came to
a halt. Then returning they examined the leaps, to
see who among them had made the longest one.</p>

<p>After they had ascertained who was the champion
in the first contest, they continued to ascend the hill
in zigzags on their skees, and after this tiresome task
they came to where they had left me.</p>

<p>I said to them, "Friends, I am going down the
hill, for I shall then be able to see better your great
leaping feats, and how wide and deep is the space you
leap over, for from the top of the hill it cannot be
seen. Wonderful, indeed, are your skill and daring!
Such tremendous leaps as you made can never be accomplished
by man except on skees. I wish I could
have been brought up to go on skees like yourselves,
from my childhood, then I should enjoy this greatly,
and compete for the championship. It is far better
fun than skating." "Certainly," they shouted with
one voice, "there is ten times more fun in skeeing
than in skating. It is like all sports, the more danger
there is in them the greater are the excitement and the
interest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," said I, "I must go down this hill in a
roundabout way, for I do not want to fall into the
hollow over which you leaped."</p>

<p>"It would not hurt you," they cried; "you would
find plenty of snow at the bottom if you should fall
in." It was agreed that one of the Lapps should
go with me and show me the way through a less steep
descent to the chasm. We made the descent successfully,
and came to a good position from which I could
see the men make the great leap.</p>

<p>Looking up, I saw all the Lapps in position ready
for the descent and waiting for the raising of the little
American flag I always carried with me,&mdash;a custom
which dates from the time of my travels in Africa&mdash;as
the signal to start. As I unfolded it, I kissed it with
great affection. How beautiful the stars and stripes
looked as they waved in the breeze and over the snow!</p>

<p>At this signal the Lapps started. Suddenly I
noticed that one of them&mdash;the last one in the row&mdash;bore
down directly upon me. "Goodness!" I said
to my companion, pointing out to him the Lapp
above, "suppose this man as he comes down should
happen to strike me."</p>

<p>The Lapp heard me with a smile, and replied:
"Paulus, do not be afraid; he will guide his skees as
skilfully as a skilful boatman steers his boat. I think
perhaps he intends to touch you with his hands as he
passes by you, so do not be frightened; do not move
an inch; he is one of the most skilful among us."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/015.png" width="600" height="388" alt="" title="" />
"Suddenly I saw them fly through the air."</div>

<p>He had hardly finished these words when the Lapp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with railroad speed and dangerously close bore down
upon me, and before I could realize it passed in front
of me within three feet, without however touching me,
as my companion had predicted. Still it took my
breath away; my heart beat so quickly. Down he
went. Before I had time to recover I saw the Lapps
in the air, over the chasm, then in the twinkling of an
eye they had alighted on the other side. Their momentum
was very great, and in less than a minute they
had leaped over the river, and continued their forward
course, which they could not stop, on the plain below;
then lessened their speed gradually with the help of
their sticks, the ends of which were thrust deep in the
snow.</p>

<p>It was a grand sight. As they leaped over their
legs were somewhat bent, and as they struck the snow
they righted themselves. While in the air they maintained
their skees parallel, as if they had been on the
snow, and when they alighted the skees were on a perfect
level with each other; no man seemed to be more
than two or three feet ahead of another.</p>

<p>I had followed their motions with great curiosity.
They seemed to give a spring as they came near the
brink of the chasm, bending their bodies forward,
straightening themselves as they struck the snow, and
continuing their way as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>On their way back, as they neared me I shouted,
"Good for you, boys! Good for you! It was splendid."
I shook hands with every one of them. They
were very much excited over the sport.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The hollow over which they leaped seemed to be
about ninety-five feet wide, and the place from which
they sprang was about twelve or fifteen feet above the
bank on the other side. They told me that some of
the great leaps in the country had been over one hundred
and twenty-five feet.</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" I exclaimed; "it seems incredible."</p>

<p>Then the Lapp who had passed so near me said
to me, "You were afraid I would strike you on my
way down. We can pass an object far below us
within a few inches when we like. We will show you
how we do by and by."</p>

<p>The Lapps once more ascended the hill, and I took
a new position by the river and waited for them to
come down. They started in the same way as before
and came down with very great speed, leaped over the
gully, and in an instant, seemingly, they were in the air
over the river&mdash;a leap of about sixty or seventy feet.</p>

<p>I shouted again, "Well done, boys! Well done!"
I was terribly excited myself.</p>

<p>Then they came to me and said: "Now we are
going to have a new game." They planted several
sticks in the snow in different positions on the declivity
of the hill, and said, "Paulus, we are going to
show you how near we can come to those sticks; we
will almost touch them with our skees."</p>

<p>When they were ready I raised my flag. They
came down the hill almost with the same rapidity as
before, but pushed their guiding sticks deeper into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
snow; and most of them came within a few inches
of the sticks.</p>

<p>After passing one they would change their direction
and move to another, either on the left or right, further
down.</p>

<p>This terminated the day's sport. We returned to
our encampment. I had had a day of great delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>We Encounter More Wolves.&mdash;My Guide Kills Two with his
Bludgeon.&mdash;A Visiting trip with a Lapp Family.&mdash;Extraordinary
Speed of Reindeer.&mdash;We Strike a Boulder.&mdash;Lake
Givij&auml;rvi.&mdash;Eastward Again.</p></div>


<p class="cap">NOW I kept a sharp lookout over the horizon as
we drove along, for I thought wolves might
make their appearance again at any moment. My
Lapp guide was also apprehensive.</p>

<p>When we stopped for our meals he said to me, "If
our reindeer scent or see wolves, they will become uncontrollable.
It will be impossible for us to stop them,
and if we try to keep in our sleighs we shall be surely
upset, for the animals will be so wild from fright.
We had better have our skees handy, so that we can
throw them out of our sleighs and then jump out
ourselves."</p>

<p>Then, brandishing his bludgeon, he said fiercely, "I
will make short work of some of them. They will
never run after any more reindeer."</p>

<p>I brandished my gun, and cried, "Woe to the
wolves if they come near us. I will give them
enough buckshot to make them jump."</p>

<p>We continued our journey, the Lapp keeping close
to me. Suddenly he stopped and said, "Paulus, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
going to tie your sleigh behind mine and fasten your
reindeer to it. I do not know why, but I have an
idea, somehow, that there are wolves around, and I expect
to see them at any moment. At any rate it is
better to be prepared for them."</p>

<p>After my sleigh was attached as he had said, we resumed
our journey, I, quietly seated in my sleigh,
having no reindeer to drive, only using my stick as a
rudder. About two hours afterwards as we skirted a
forest of fir trees we suddenly saw two wolves skulking
in the distance. Fortunately we discovered them before
the reindeer did. We threw out our skees, and
then the Lapp with his bludgeon and I with my gun
jumped out. We were hardly out when our reindeer
scented the wolves and plunged wildly in their efforts
to escape, and we had to let them go, for we could not
hold them.</p>

<p>The Lapp in an instant was on his skees armed
with his bludgeon. He made directly for the wolves
at tremendous speed. He seemed to fly over the
snow, and before I knew it he had slain a wolf by
giving him a mighty blow on his skull. Then like a
bird of prey he made for the other wolf. The animal
stood still, ready to bite him, but the Lapp passed by
him like a flash and gave him a terrible blow on his
mouth which broke his teeth. Then after he had
stopped the speed of his skees, he turned back and
gave him his deathblow.</p>

<p>After he had taken breath, he said to me, "Paulus,
wait here, for you cannot 'skee' fast enough. I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
go after our runaway reindeer and our sleighs," and
off he went. He followed the tracks they had left
behind them.</p>

<p>I waited one hour, two hours,&mdash;I thought he
would never come back. Finally I saw a little black
speck over the snow. It was my Lapp, and soon
he was by my side with reindeer and sleighs.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we came to a tent, where we were
kindly received, and there we slept. The next morning
the owner of the tent said to me, "The snow is
very fine for sleighing, for it is crisp and well packed.
The weather is cold and travelling with reindeer could
not be better, for the animals will feel fine. Some of
my people and I want to go and visit my brother and
his family. Will you come with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I shall be very glad to go with
you."</p>

<p>A short time after this five reindeer made their appearance;
they were all males, and splendid animals,&mdash;Samoyeds,
the finest and largest I had thus far
seen. Their antlers were superb.</p>

<p>"These reindeer," said their owner, "are the fastest
I have, and are in their prime for driving, for they
are between six and eight years old, the age when
they are the strongest. They have not been used for
two weeks, so they feel very frisky; and it being so cold
they will run at a rate that will perhaps scare you, and
I am sure they will go as fast as they ever did. No
reindeer that I know of can keep pace with them. I
have taken great care in training them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>I was delighted at the thought of travelling with
such fast animals, and I replied, "I am sure I shall
enjoy the drive."</p>

<p>Then everybody got ready for the start. My host,
pointing to one of the biggest reindeer, said to me,
"This one will be yours, and you will follow me."</p>

<p>We were hardly ready when the reindeer started at
a furious rate and in the wildest way. The Lapps
held their reins as hard as they could and threw themselves
across their sleighs and were carried in that way
for a little distance. It was a most ludicrous sight,
the like of which I had never seen! But they all
succeeded in getting in&mdash;they were masters of the
situation.</p>

<p>How they succeeded in getting in I could not tell,
it was certainly a great feat of gymnastics. My reindeer
had started with the rest and was ahead of them
all, but soon the Lapps overtook me.</p>

<p>We went on at a tremendous rate. These were
indeed the fastest reindeer I had ever travelled with.
It was a good thing that I had learned how to balance
myself in those little Lapp sleighs. I did not mind
any more their swinging to and fro. I rather liked
the excitement. And it was exciting enough! We
went so fast that things appeared and disappeared
almost before I had time to look at them.</p>

<p>We sped with such rapidity that I fancied I was
travelling on the Pennsylvania railroad, as I often
had done on the Limited to Chicago on the way to
see my Scandinavian friends and others. I was thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of that splendid train with its luxurious cars&mdash;of
the observation cars with their comfortable chairs,
sofas, library; of the bath room, stenographer, and
barber, and polite employees, and all the comforts
travellers had. Suddenly I thought of its fine dining-room
cars, and as I was hungry I imagined I was
seated before one of its tables, with snowy-white linen,
and enjoying a glorious meal,&mdash;oysters, capon, roast
beef, vegetables of several kinds, and puddings and
fruits; the ice cream I dismissed, for I did not feel like
having any, it was so cold. Then I thought of its
comfortable beds&mdash;when suddenly a tremendous
bumping, which almost threw me out, reminded me
that I was not on that luxurious train. I had struck a
snag or boulder. This made it clear at once that I was
dreaming and was not on the Chicago Limited, but that
I was travelling in "The Land of the Long Night."</p>

<p>The air was so rarefied, the drive so exciting, that I
shouted with all my might, "Go on, reindeer, go on.
This is fine, I never had such a drive in my life."</p>

<p>After two hours, and a drive of nearly fifty miles,
we alighted before a Lapp tent. The dogs, and there
were many, announced our arrival by fierce barking,
and the inmates of the tent came out to see who the
strangers were. They recognized my friends and
received them with demonstrations of joy, which was
the more remarkable as the Lapps are far from being
demonstrative.</p>

<p>The next day in the afternoon we returned to our
tent, the reindeer as frisky as the day before and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
running as fast. I have never forgotten those two
glorious rides, and I shall remember them as long as I
live.</p>

<p>Bidding my Lapp friends good-bye I came one
day to Lake Givij&auml;rvi and further on to Lake Aitij&auml;rvi.
There I saw a lonely farm with a comfortable dwelling-house
of logs. How pleasant this habitation
seemed in that snow land. The smoke curling over
the chimney told that there were people there, and soon
after we were in front of the house, and I entered a
large room, and saw a man with long black shaggy
hair tinged with grey. His name was Adam Triump.
Then a woman, his wife, came in, also with loose
shaggy black hair falling over her shoulders. My
guide and I were made welcome.</p>

<p>From there I travelled once more eastward, driving
over the Ivalajoki, which falls into the Enarej&auml;rvi.
If I had been travelling alone I should certainly have
perished, for I did not know where to find the people
of the thinly inhabited country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>The Lapp Hamlet of Kautokeino.&mdash;A Bath in a Big Iron Pot.&mdash;An
Arctic Way of Washing Clothes.&mdash;Dress and Ornaments
of the Lapps.&mdash;Appearance and Height of the
Lapps.&mdash;Givij&auml;rvi.&mdash;Karasjok.</p></div>


<p class="cap">A FEW days after the events I have just related
to you, I found myself in the Lapp hamlet of
Kautokeino, with its Lutheran church, near latitude 69
degrees. Here and there were queer-looking storehouses
which belonged to the nomadic Lapps. I
alighted before the post station, and entered the house
and was welcomed by the station master. The dwelling
was composed of two rooms, one for the use of
the family, the other for guests or travellers. The
place was full of Lapp men and women who had come
to rest, go to church on the following Sunday, or see
their children who were at school; or to get coffee,
sugar, and other provisions stored in their own houses.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the post station was the
cow house, and between it and the house was the old-fashioned
wooden-bucket well with its long, swinging
pole, surrounded by a thick mass of ice made of the
dripping water from the bucket. I did not wonder
when I saw the ice, for it was 43 degrees below zero
that day, and sometimes it is colder still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>I went into the cow-house. It was, as usual, a very
low building, lower than most of those I had seen
before. The two long windows admitted a dim light.
At the further end was the usual big iron pot seen in
almost every cow-house, for soaking the grass in boiling
water, as the coarse marsh grass is so hard to chew
that it has to be thus prepared. The daughter of the
house, a girl about twenty years old, said to me, "I am
going to prepare a meal for the cows and the sheep."</p>

<p>The huge iron pot was filled with reindeer moss and
grass and warm water. "This food is for the cows
and sheep," she said. "The horse is fed on fine
fragrant hay, gathered during the short summer;
horses will not eat the food we give to the cows and
sheep; they are very particular."</p>

<p>I was very much in need of a good wash and of a
warm bath, for I had only used snow to wash my
hands and face for many days. As I looked at the
big iron pot I said to myself, "This pot will make
a good wash-tub."</p>

<p>I went to the mistress of the house and asked her if
I could take a warm bath in the big iron pot. "Certainly,"
she replied. Then she called her daughter,
and both went to the cow-house. They cleaned the
iron pot thoroughly; then filled it about two thirds
full with water from the trough communicating with
the well, which the old station master drew for them.
They lighted a fire under the pot, and cleaned the
surroundings, and laid down a reindeer skin for my
feet, and a chair for me to sit on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>When the water was warm, and the fire under it
extinguished, the wife said that my bath was ready.</p>

<p>How good I felt when I was in the big iron pot
filled with warm water. I gave grunts of satisfaction.
I put my head under water and thought "How good;
how good the water feels."</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the family appeared, and before I
had time to say "What do you want?" had jumped
into the water all dressed and got hold of one of my
legs and rubbed it with soap. Then came the turn of
the other leg, then the body, head and all. I was
rubbed with a brush as hard as if I had been a piece
of wood that had no feelings, and as if my skin had
been the bark of a tree. Two or three times I
screamed out, but my attendant only laughed. After
the rubbing I was switched with birch twigs till I
fairly glowed, and then I was left alone. When I
looked at my body my skin was as red as a tomato.
The blood was in full circulation and I felt fine, for it
was such a long time since I had taken a real bath
that I had almost forgotten that there was such a
thing.</p>

<p>How nice it was to put clean underwear on. How
comfortable it felt. I put on a new pair of reindeer
trousers, that were lent to me and that had never been
worn before, and a new "kapta." Here was a good
occasion to have my underwear washed, and my fur garments
cleansed of everything, for it was over 40 degrees
below zero. This wearing of the same clothes for a
long time is the greatest hardship of travelling in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
winter in the Arctic regions; for in the course of time
obnoxious things swarm in the fur and also in the
woollen underwear. When these become unendurable
the following way of washing has to be performed
without soap or water.</p>

<p>After a person has changed his fur garments and
underwear, he hangs them outside when the temperature
is from 20 to 50 degrees below zero. The colder
it is, the better for the clothes that are to be cleansed.
These are left hanging for several days, during which
time all the noxious things are killed by the intense
cold. After this the underwear and the fur garments
are well shaken and beaten, and then they return from
this kind of laundry clean, according to the views of the
Arctic regions, and are ready to be worn again. I often
had my clothing washed in that manner, and also my
sleeping-bags.</p>

<p>On Sunday many Lapps attended the Lutheran
church from different parts of the country, coming
either on skees or with their sleighs; those who lived
far away starting the day before. Some had come
even so far as one hundred and fifty miles. I was
present at the religious services; the church was
crowded. The clergyman was not in his clerical robes,
but dressed in furs&mdash;like the rest of the congregation,
for the churches are not heated.</p>

<p>On my return from church, the Lapps asked me
where I was going. I replied I wanted to go as far
as the land went north of me, as far as Nordkyn.
They all wondered why I wanted to go there. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
asked me if I was a merchant and bought fish. I
told them I was not, but that I travelled to see the
country and its people. They thought I was a very
strange man, and they wondered at my ways.</p>

<p>This hamlet was composed of about twelve homesteads.
The dwelling-houses were built of logs, those
for beasts of turf or stones. By the church was the
schoolhouse, and there was a large store very much
like our country stores at home.</p>

<p>The inhabitants owned about sixty cows,&mdash;such
small cows! they were about three feet in height&mdash;one
hundred and seventy sheep and a few oxen as
small as the cows.</p>

<p>Kautokeino was full of nomadic Lapps, and we had
a good time together, for the Lapps are very friendly
and I had learned to love them. "We come here,"
they said, "to meet our friends, to see our children
who are in school, to get some of the provisions kept
in our storehouses and other things we want; and we
bring with us skins of reindeer and the garments and
shoes that have been made in our tents."</p>

<p>In this church hamlet were a number of very
old Lapps, men and women who could no longer
follow their reindeer and endure a hard, wandering
life. Thither also the sick or the lame come,
to stay until they get well or die. Two Lapps were
pointed out to me who were nearly one hundred years
old.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these Lapp hamlets are not
nomadic; they live on the produce of their farms, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
increase of their reindeer, by catching salmon, and in
employing themselves as sailors on the fishing-boats
of the Arctic Sea, which they reach by descending the
rivers.</p>

<p>The Lapp women wore queer-fitting little caps of
bright colors, and when in holiday dress wore a number
of large showy silk handkerchiefs. Sometimes they
had as many as four, on the top of one another, over
their fur dresses; they wore necklaces of large glass
beads, round their waists were silver belts, and their
fingers were ornamented with rings. They wore
trousers of reindeer skin, as the Lapp women do universally.
The men wore peaked caps.</p>

<p>These people were short of stature, compactly but
slightly built, with strong limbs, their light weight
allowing them to climb, jump, and run quickly. There
are no heavy men with big stomachs among them.
Quite a number of Lapps have fair hair and blue
eyes. They are unlike the Esquimaux, and in a
crowd at home, dressed like ourselves, would pass
unnoticed. There are a number of Lapps in the
North-west of our own county. The tallest woman
that I saw was 5 feet &frac12; inch, the tallest man 5 feet
4&frac12; inches; the smallest woman 4 feet 4&frac14; inches,
the smallest man 4 feet 7 inches. There were more
women averaging 4 feet 10 inches than men of that
size, men averaging generally above five feet.</p>

<p>I left Kautokeino, and that same day I came to Lake
Givij&auml;rvi. I had to be told that it was a lake, for it
was a continuous snow-land. Here was a farm, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
owner of which kept a small store and sold sugar,
coffee, salt, flour, tobacco, matches, some woollen
underwear, etc., to the Lapps; and bought from them
skins, shoes, and gloves, in summer smoked tongue
and reindeer meat, reindeer cheese, etc., and every
year went with these to some of the Norwegian towns
on the Arctic Sea to sell them and buy groceries and
other goods.</p>

<p>Here I had a clean room and bed. The place was
a great rendezvous for nomadic Lapps, and I found
many of them. The farmer extended to them unbounded
hospitality, and spread as many reindeer skins
on the floor at night as the room could hold, for them
to sleep on.</p>

<p>The Lapps liked the place very much, and came there
to rest for a few days, bringing their food with them.
Their wives and children would also come, and were
sure to be welcome at the farm. I could not drink
sufficient milk or coffee, or eat enough reindeer meat,
cheese, or butter that had been churned in summer, to
please the good-hearted farmer. He wanted no pay.
He even insisted on accompanying me to Karasjok.</p>

<p>The sleighing was fine, and the snow was six and
seven feet deep on a level. Our arrival at Karasjok,
after a hundred miles' journey from Givij&auml;rvi, was
announced by the fierce barking of the dogs of the
place, and twice I was almost overtaken by one more
fierce than the others. "They only bark," shouted
my guide. I was now in latitude 69&deg; 35', and within
a few miles of the longitude of Nordkyn. The hamlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was situated on the shores of the Karasjoki river.
Some of the fir trees of the forests near Karasjok
measured twenty inches in diameter; but once cut they
do not grow again. I saw very few young trees.</p>

<p>The hamlet was composed of eighteen or twenty
homesteads, with about one hundred and thirty inhabitants.
There were over twenty horses, besides cows,
sheep, and reindeer. The horses were so plentiful
because they are used to haul timber. I reflected
that the horse is a wonderful animal, and can live
like man in many kinds of climate.</p>

<p>All the houses at Karasjok were built of logs.
The finest residence was that of the merchant of the
place. The Karasjok Lapps, and others in the neighborhood,
were very unlike those I had seen before.
They were tall; some of them six feet in height.
The women were also tall, most of them having dark
hair. The fair complexion and blue eyes were uncommon.
Men and women wore strange-looking head-dresses.
The men wore square caps of red or blue
flannel, filled up with eider down. The women put
on a wooden framework of very peculiar shape,
appearing more or less like a casque or the helmet of
a dragoon.</p>

<p>I only stopped the night in Karasjok, and after getting
new reindeer at the post station and a new guide,
started north.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Leave Karasjok still Travelling Northward.&mdash;The River
Tana.&mdash;River Lapps.&mdash;Filthy Dwellings.&mdash;On the Way
to Nordkyn.&mdash;The Most Northern Land in Europe.</p></div>


<p class="cap">ON leaving Karasjok I travelled northward, over
the frozen Karasjoki, until I came to a broad
stream called the Tana. As we drove on the river
I saw here and there solitary farms and strange little
hamlets inhabited by river Lapps.</p>

<p>The occupation of the river Lapps is largely salmon
catching in summer. These fish are very abundant
in the rivers. Many, during the codfish season, engage
themselves as sailors on the Arctic Sea. Almost
every family has a small farm, stocked with diminutive
cows; besides they have sheep and goats. During
the summer their reindeer are taken care of by the
nomadic Lapps. These reindeer have to go to the
mountains near the Arctic Sea, on account of the
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Now travelling was becoming very hard,&mdash;not on
account of the snow, but because the inhabitants
and their dwellings were so dirty.</p>

<p>But I had one comfort. All over that far northern
land I felt so safe; it never came into my head that
these people would rob me, though they knew I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
plenty of money with me, according to their ways of
thinking, to pay for reindeer and other travelling expenses;
but the Finns and the Lapps are a God-fearing
people.</p>

<p>The first day, I came to a place occupied by a
single man. The house was so filthy, and vermin
apparently so plentiful, that I whispered to my Lapp
guide, "Let us go on." The Lapp was so tired that
he looked at me with astonishment, and seemed to
say: "Are not these comfortable quarters?"</p>

<p>We got into our sleighs, however, and further on
we stopped and tied our reindeer together. The
Lapp slept in his sleigh covered with a reindeer skin,
and I in my bag.</p>

<p>The next day we halted before a farm. It was
dark. There we intended to spend the night. The
people do not lock their doors, neither do they knock
to obtain admittance. So we entered. The family
were all in bed. A man lighted a light. Such filth I
thought I had never seen. The beds were filled with
dirty hay that had been there all winter. The sheepskin
blankets with the wool on were almost as black
as soot. The people who slept between them were
without a particle of clothes. "What a place for
vermin!" I whispered to myself.</p>

<p>At this sight, I again said in a low voice to my Lapp,
"Let us go on." He replied, "The reindeer are
hungry, and we have had no food ourselves for long
hours. Let us remain overnight and breakfast here
to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time the owner of the place got up, put
on a long dirty woolen shirt, and went with us into the
next room, which was clean. I gave a sigh of relief.
The wooden bed had no hay, no sheepskin blankets.
The man got for me a clean reindeer skin which he
said had just come out of the open air, where it had
been for several days.</p>

<p>To my consternation my Lapp guide offered to
sleep alongside of me, and added, "We shall be warmer
if we sleep together." I was in a dilemma. I did not
want to offend him, but I told him that I always slept
by myself. Then the owner of the place spread another
reindeer skin on the floor, and my guide slept upon it.</p>

<p>The next morning we breakfasted on dried reindeer
meat, hard bread, and milk. After bidding our
host good-bye, and thanking him for his hospitality,
we continued our journey, arriving towards noon at a
farm owned by a river Lapp. The farm had three
buildings; only the wife and daughter were at home.
The husband was cod fishing in the Arctic Sea. The
wife told me she had been a sailor before she was
married, and engaged in cod fishing.</p>

<p>There were on this farm three diminutive cows, an
ox of the size of the cows, nine sheep, and they owned
besides quite a number of reindeer. The cows were
getting smaller and smaller as I went north. In the
little dwelling-house was a small room for a stranger;
reindeer skins made the mattress. My guide and I
ate together. We had excellent coffee, smoked reindeer
meat, and milk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Further on we stopped awhile at a little farm owned
by a woman and her daughter. The mother and
daughter worked as if they were men; they fished
for salmon in the river in summer, mowed hay, collected
reindeer moss to feed their cows, went after
wood. A faithful dog was their companion. At some
seasons the daughter descended the river, and engaged
herself as one of the crew on board of a fishing
boat on the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Resuming our journey we passed the church hamlet
of Utsjoki. Near Utsjoki I met some nomadic
Lapps, who had a large herd of reindeer with them,
and were willing to take me to Nordkyn. That
night I slept in their tent. Early the next morning
they lassoed some very fine reindeer, which had
superb horns and had not been used for quite a while.
I did not care now how fast the reindeer went, for I
could keep inside of my sleigh. The men said:
"We will meet on the promontory Lapps with their
reindeer herds, and if it is very stormy we can go into
their tent."</p>

<p>Soon after we started.</p>

<p>They were not mistaken in regard to the speed of
their beasts. They set off at a furious pace, and it
was all I could do to keep inside of my sleigh. My
pride was up, and I was bound to do my utmost not
to upset.</p>

<p>We finally reached the high promontory which
divides the Laxe from the Tana fjord, at the extremity
of which is Nordkyn. It was blowing a gale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
right from the north, and we had to protect our faces
with our masks. Fortunately we came to a Lapp encampment,
and were received with great kindness and
hospitality; enjoyed a good meal of reindeer meat,
and a good sleep afterwards.</p>

<p>The next morning the weather was fine, and I
drove on to Kjorgosk Njarg&mdash;hard name to pronounce&mdash;the
most northern land in Europe.</p>

<p>The land's end was nearing, and erelong I stood
on the edge of Cape Nordkyn, 71&deg; 6' 50"&mdash;the most
northern end of the continent of Europe, and rising
majestically over seven hundred feet above the level
of the sea. Before me was the Arctic Ocean, and
beyond, a long way off and unseen by me, was the
impenetrable wall of ice which the Long Night had
built to guard the Pole.</p>

<p>From there I could see North Cape.</p>

<p class="cap">NORDKYN being the land's end, I could not
go further north, so I retraced my steps southward.
That afternoon we saw on the other side of a
frozen lakelet the tent of some nomadic Lapps, and
we made preparations to cross the lake to go and
see them.</p>

<p>While we were in the midst of the lake the wind
rose, and before we knew it the ice was left bare
around us, and our reindeer could not run or walk
over it, it was so slippery. They would fall at every
step they made, making all kinds of contortions to
try to stand on their legs; their hoofs could not possibly
hold on fast to the ice. We got out of our sleighs
to help them. I said to myself that reindeer ought
to be shod, especially to go over the ice.</p>

<p>It was awful&mdash;the poor beasts made frantic efforts
to get on, but could not. I thought we should never
be able to cross the lake, and that we should be
obliged to abandon the reindeer, or try to put them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into our sleighs, and drag these ourselves to the shore.
But we watched our opportunity, and when a layer
of snow was blown in our way, we succeeded in
making some headway. At last we reached the shore,
after three or four hours of hard work.</p>

<p>The Lapps received us very kindly.</p>

<p>That night I heard the weird and dismal howls of
foxes. They sounded so strange in the stillness of
darkness. In the morning I asked the Lapps how
many kinds of foxes were found in the country.
"There are red, blue, and black foxes," they answered.
"During the Bear's Night or winter months the blue
foxes and the gray hares turn white; the fur of the
black fox is tipped with white, and he is known as the
silver-gray fox, the fur thus tipped being very valuable.
The ptarmigan also, a species of grouse, turns white
during the Bear's Night."</p>

<p>I asked the Lapps, "Why do you call the winter
months the 'Bear's Night'?"</p>

<p>"Because," one replied, "in this land the bears sleep
all through the winter months."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" I exclaimed; "then the bear has a
sleep that lasts five or six months, and even more?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Lapp replied.</p>

<p>"Are there any bears here," I asked, "that are
sleeping in the neighborhood?&mdash;for I should like immensely
to stir one up."</p>

<p>"There are none this year," he replied.</p>

<p>Then I said to him, "Let us go fox hunting, for I
should like to get some white and silver-gray fox-skins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
We will build a snow house for our camp to
shelter ourselves." One of the Lapps, called Jakob,
agreed to go with me.</p>

<p>Besides hunting foxes, we were to trap ermines and
kill white hares, for I wanted to have a rug of their
skins. I remembered that I had slept between two
rugs of white hare skins, and how beautiful, soft, and
warm they were.</p>

<p>After this talk Jakob went off after reindeer, and
returned with three of them. In a short time our
preparations for camping were made. We took with
us our sleeping-bags, some reindeer meat, a little salt,
some hard bread, a coffee kettle, coffee, a small iron pot
to cook our food in, two wooden shovels to help us
in building a snow house and clearing the ground of
snow, our skees, guns, and ammunition. I did not
forget a couple of wax candles, for I always carried
some with me, and plenty of matches, besides a steel
and flints in case some accident should happen to our
matches. We took also a few slender poles, upon
which we intended to hang our meat to keep it out of
reach of prowling carnivorous animals. These carefully
packed and made secure in a special sleigh, we
started. Our sleighs glided along as if they were
going on smooth ice.</p>

<p>After a journey of four hours, having travelled
about sixty miles, we came to the shores of a lake, and
at one end were two conical dwellings belonging to
fishing or river Lapps. The smoke curling above
their tops showed us the people were at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here," said Jakob, "we will build our snow
houses. I think we shall find plenty of foxes in the
neighborhood, for the country is full of ptarmigans,
and the foxes prey upon them."</p>

<p>We tied our reindeer with long ropes, so that they
should have plenty of room to dig for moss. Then
we began to build our snow house. It was so cold
that the snow did not hold well together, so we concluded
to make two instead of one, just big enough
for each of us to sleep in and be protected from the
great cold. It was hard work. When finished they
were a little over five feet and a half long and some
three feet wide inside.</p>

<p>"I like this much better than going in and sleeping
in the dwellings of the river or fishing Lapps yonder,"
I said to Jakob.</p>

<p>Clearing a space for our fire in front, we put up
three long poles we had carried with us, and hung our
meat high up upon them, so that wolves and foxes
could not get at it. Then we put our sleighs containing
our outfit on the top of each other and made
them fast with cords. When this was done Jakob
said: "Foxes are often very bold, and they come and
rummage around the tents; and when famished they
bite everything they get hold of. We shall be able
to hear them from our snow houses if they try to get
into our sleighs."</p>

<p>We had carried with us a few sticks of dry wood to
be used as firewood, but Jakob knew the country
well and that near us were some junipers, the branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of which appeared above the snow, and he went and
gathered some of them. The wood of the juniper,
though green, burns well, for it is full of resinous
matter.</p>

<p>Our camp was now ready. The day's work being
done we lighted a fire, cooked a piece of reindeer meat
for our supper, and made coffee. Jakob, as usual,
had some dried fish skin with him to clarify the coffee.
After our meal we went into our snow houses, and
taking off my Lapp grass and stockings, I laid them
inside of my kapta on my chest to dry the dampness
out of them during the night. Then I got into my
bag. Jakob did likewise, and after bidding each other
good-night we fell asleep. Our houses were warm and
comfortable.</p>

<p>During the night we were startled by the piercing
howls of foxes, and these kept us awake for a time.
How dismal those howls sounded. We had evidently
come to a good place to find foxes! Jakob evidently
knew what he was about, and had brought me to the
right place.</p>

<p>When we awoke the weather had become colder,
the thermometer marking 45 degrees below zero.
After a breakfast of reindeer meat and a cup of
coffee we went to reconnoitre on our skees and saw
many tracks of foxes. I was delighted at the discovery,
and said to myself, "Paul, do not leave this place till
you have a few fox skins." I wished all the time that
these tracks might be those of the white and silver-gray
foxes, for they were the ones I particularly wanted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>On our return the fishing Lapps from the other
side of the lake came on their skees to pay us a visit,
and invited us to come and see them. Looking at
their faces I thought they had not been washed for
months, for a coat of dirt covered their skins. I
looked at their fur garments with great suspicion, and
kept away from them without appearing to do so. I
found it necessary to use all the tact I possessed to
avoid wounding their susceptibilities.</p>

<p>After their departure Jakob said: "I am going to
take the reindeer to some friends of mine who have
their camp within two hours from this place, and
they will take care of them until we go back."
Then he bade me good-bye, saying, "I will not be
long."</p>

<p>I watched him until I lost sight of him and of the
reindeer. Then I put on my skees, took my gun, and
went to look for foxes, and soon came upon fresh
tracks of them. Once or twice I thought I saw white
foxes, but they are difficult to see at a long distance,
being of the color of the snow, and I could not be
sure. Being satisfied of their presence in our neighborhood,
I returned to the camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/016.png" width="600" height="384" alt="" title="" />
"I advanced cautiously."</div>

<p>As I came within sight of our shelter I thought I
saw on the snow, near one of the poles where the reindeer
meat was hung, something that was not there
when I had left. It was possible that it was only
the snow that had been piled up in heaps by us.
"Strange," I said to myself, "that I did not notice
that this morning." I advanced cautiously, when suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
I discovered that what I thought so strange
was three foxes, white ones, seated and looking up
intently at the reindeer meat, probably thinking how
they might reach it. I watched them while they stood
still and kept their heads up, looking at the meat. I
was glad the meat was out of their reach, otherwise we
should have had no supper. I stood perfectly still and
kept watching them. The three foxes did not move.
Suddenly one turned round, and when he saw me he
gave the alarm to his companions and off they ran at
a great rate, and soon were out of sight.</p>

<p>When I came to the camp I saw that the foxes had
gone round and round the pole, in the hope of finding
a way to reach the meat. It was lucky that they had
not intelligence enough to dig the snow with their
paws at the foot of the pole to make it come down.</p>

<p>After this, looking over the snow, I saw in the
distance a little black spot, which grew bigger and
bigger as it came nearer. I recognized Jakob on his
skees.</p>

<p>Soon after he arrived in our camp I told him about
the foxes. "They will come again," he replied, "for
they are hungry. Other foxes will also come, for they
will surely scent our meat."</p>

<p>After a while we began to work, and built two little
round enclosures of snow, the walls about three feet
high, with openings here and there to fire from, and
went inside and waited for the foxes, having previously
put within a short shooting distance some
reindeer meat. We waited for quite a while&mdash;no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
foxes&mdash;when suddenly I thought I saw something
moving over the snow. Looking carefully I found
that they were white foxes. They had evidently
scented the meat and were approaching in that direction,
and when within shooting distance we fired and
two of them fell. They were fine creatures, with soft
long hair almost as white as the snow upon which they
walked. We skinned them at once, and stretched their
skins on frames we made from branches of juniper.</p>

<p>The next day we built two new snow entrenchments,
in the opposite direction to the others, and
when it was dark we went into them, putting reindeer
meat near.</p>

<p>We had not to wait long. I saw something black
on the snow. Certainly the animal was not a white
fox. It could not be the cub of a bear, for it was the
Bear's Night and they were all asleep. When the
animal was near enough I fired and it fell. I ran
towards it, and saw that it was a splendid silver-gray
fox. How carefully we skinned the animal!</p>

<p>The next day Jakob made a lot of traps for ermines.
These traps are made in the following manner: A
string is attached to a loop long enough for the head
of the animal to pass through. The string is fastened
to a branch, which is bent down above the place
where meat is deposited, some distance back of the
loop. The ermine approaches, and in trying to reach
the meat pushes his head through the loop and pulls
the string up, and the loop tightens round the neck
and strangles the animal in the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>We scattered these traps in every direction, and
caught many ermines. How pretty is the ermine,
with its short legs, white fur, and tail tipped with black!
The ermine feeds much on the ptarmigans.</p>

<p>That day I saw perched on the low branch of a tree
a beautiful snowy owl, motionless, evidently watching
for something. Jakob said to me, "The owl is watching
for ermines. There are plenty of these, I am sure,
round here, or the owl would not be on this tree. We
will set some of our traps here." The owl was big
and beautiful, and I said to myself, "The ermine
feeds on the ptarmigans, and the owl on the ermine."
I did not like the idea of the harmless ptarmigans being
eaten by ermines and owls, so I raised my gun and
knocked him over.</p>

<p>The foxes, after being hunted for two or three days,
became very shy and it was impossible to get near
them. There were a great number of ptarmigans, and
they were so tame that we had no difficulty in getting
many for food.</p>

<p>Strange to say, when we fired our guns they made
hardly any noise, for the air was so rarefied. We
feasted well at our camp, for we also killed a number
of white hares.</p>

<p>The white fox had become so scarce that we concluded
to leave our camp for good, and Jakob went
to get our reindeer. After packing we retraced our
steps towards his home, his tent on the snow.</p>

<p>In one place where we stopped to rest I suddenly
noticed that our reindeer had got loose. I shouted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to Jakob, who was quietly taking a little snooze on
the snow, "Our reindeer are loose!"</p>

<p>Without saying a word, he went to his sleigh and
took a lasso. The Lapps never travel without a lasso.
This reassured me. "I must be very wary, for our
reindeer are somewhat wild," Jakob said; "Paulus,
follow me." So I took to my skees. As we approached
the animals moved off from us. Then he
came near enough to one of them, and threw his lasso
and caught him. After making the animal fast, he
went carefully after the others and succeeded in lassoing
them.</p>

<p>"Well done," I said to him. Then we lay on the
snow, with our masks to protect our faces, and went to
sleep. After a short nap we continued our way, and
finally reached Jakob's tent just in time for supper,
and were warmly welcomed by the family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Jakob Talks to Me about Bears.&mdash;The Bear's Night.&mdash;Watching
a Bear Seeking for Winter Quarters.&mdash;They Are
Very Suspicious.&mdash;I Tell a Bear Story in my Turn.</p></div>


<p class="cap">SINCE I had heard of the Bear's Night, I wanted
to know more about these animals and their
habits. After our supper, I said to Jakob, "Talk
about bears to me&mdash;tell me about them." "All
right," he replied. "I will tell you all I know about
them."</p>

<p>"At the end of the summer and before the first fall
of snow," he began, "the bears are very fat, for they
have had plenty of berries and roots to eat. They
are so fat that they can stand the long fast during the
Bear's Night; but when they go out in the spring
from their snow cover, they are very lean. We
dread the bear more in the spring than during any
part of the summer, for he is voraciously hungry all
the time and goes after cattle, horses, sheep, or
reindeer."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder at their being hungry, for the
poor bear has to make up for his long fast," I said.</p>

<p>Jakob continued: "The bear chooses a place in
which he can lie comfortably, such as under boulders
or fallen trees, where he can be protected from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
snow. He becomes suspicious after he has chosen
the place for his Winter's Night, and for days he walks
round and round to see that there is no danger and to
make sure that no enemy can see him. He wants to
feel perfectly safe before he goes into winter quarters.
By walking round wherever the wind blows, he is sure
to scent danger, and if he does he moves away and
goes to seek some other place. The bear is very
wary; it is almost impossible in summer to pursue
him without dogs, for he is so quick of foot and
always on the alert, that when a hunter sees one he
has to be more wary than the bear to approach within
shooting distance of him. When badly wounded he
attacks his enemy suddenly."</p>

<p>After Jakob had done speaking, I said to him, in
my turn: "Let me tell you a bear story. One
autumn day when I had crossed the mountains by
the great Sulitelma glacier and was descending the
eastern slope on my way to the Gulf of Bothnia, my
Lapp guide and I saw a big brown bear in the distance,
but as it was almost dark we decided not to
go after him, for the country was very stony. We
camped that day in a forest of pines, in order to be
sheltered from the wind, for we were to sleep without
a fire so as not to make the bear suspicious. After
taking our frugal meal of hard bread and butter, my
Lapp said to me, 'To-morrow we shall see the bear;
it is late in the season, and I am sure that he is looking
for his winter quarters in the neighborhood, and
at the first indication of a big snowstorm he will make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ready for his long sleep, for the bears know when a
snowstorm is coming.'</p>

<p>"'How can they know?' I inquired.</p>

<p>"'I cannot tell you, for I do not know,' he replied,
'for I am not a bear; but they do know. Do not the
swallows and other migrating birds know the approach
of winter and then fly southward?'</p>

<p>"'They do,' I replied.</p>

<p>"That day we were very tired, for we had been
tramping all day, down and up hills and leaping over
boulders which covered the country in many places, and
the wonder to me was that we did not break our necks.</p>

<p>"The place we had chosen for the night was by a
big boulder almost as large as a small house. There
we could be sheltered against the cold wind of the
night that came through the trees. I picked out a
stone for a pillow, then stretched myself by the side of
the boulder on thick lichen that grew over the barren
soil, and made a comfortable bed. My guide did
likewise. Then we bade each other good-night and
soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>"The next morning we wandered in the neighborhood
where we had seen the bear, but that day we did
not find him; then we moved in the direction whither
we thought he had gone. That evening we saw
another boulder some twelve or fifteen feet high.
'This will be a fine place of shelter for the night,' I
said to the Lapp. He replied, 'It is just the place
we want. If the wind shifts we will shift also, so as to
be protected.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I lay flat along the boulder on the thick reindeer
moss, the Lapp did likewise, and soon after we fell
asleep with the pure bracing wind of the mountains
blowing over our faces.</p>

<p>"The next morning we saw the bear; he was a long
way from us. The Lapp said to me, 'I think the
bear expects to winter round here; we must watch
him and follow him.' Soon after the bear disappeared.</p>

<p>"'Do you think he has scented us?' I asked. 'I
do not see how he could,' my guide replied, 'the wind
is in the wrong direction for that. He has gone for
some reason of his own, you may be sure. There
may have been people on the other side of the hill
and he has scented them.'</p>

<p>"We moved all round our boulder to scan the
country, but there was no bear in sight as far as our
eyes could reach. After a while I noticed a small
black spot on the top of a hill. It was the bear; he
was looking all round. He then walked away and
disappeared. Soon he appeared again, and we saw
him walk round and round a cluster of pines. The
Lapp said: 'The bear is walking, making a ring in
that manner. He tries to find out if there is any
danger for him, and by walking round he is sure to get
the wind, no matter from what direction it comes.
Sometimes the bear will try a number of places for
several days before he selects one.'</p>

<p>"'How clever the bears are to walk around in that
manner,' I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suddenly the bear disappeared. 'He has scented
us,' said the Lapp, 'and I think he will never come
back here. We have eaten all the food we have with
us. We shall have to feed on berries the rest of our
way. This bear will probably remain in this region
and take up his winter quarters around here somewhere.
I will find out where he will lie. Come to
me early in the spring, before the snow melts, and we
will kill him.'</p>

<p>"'All right,' I replied; but the following spring, I
regret to say, I was travelling in another part of the
country, but I heard that Bruin met his fate at the
hands of my Lapp when he aroused himself from his
long sleep and came out from under the snow."</p>

<p>The bears in Sweden, Norway, and Finland are
very fine animals and attain great size. They vary in
the color of their fur, some being almost black, but
generally they are of different shades of brown. I
think they rank in size next to the grizzly bear of the
Rocky Mountains. They are sometimes dangerous,
but not so much so as the grizzly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Preparations for Crossing the Mountains to the Arctic Ocean.&mdash;Decide
to Take the Trail to the Ulf Fjord.&mdash;Houses
of Refuge.&mdash;A Series of Terrific Windstorms
in the Mountains.&mdash;Lost.&mdash;Gloomy Reflections.&mdash;A
Happy Reunion.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE next day I said to Jakob and to the Lapps,
"I wish some of you to go with me across the
mountains to the shore of the Arctic Ocean. I will
pay you well."</p>

<p>We were then between the 69th and 70th degrees,
north latitude, and we had to cross the mountains at
an elevation of about 5,000 feet on our way to the
sea. I wanted to find out the kind of weather they
had in these high altitudes in the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>"Some of us will go with you," they replied; and
added: "There are several trails leading to the Arctic
Ocean. We can reach the sea by going to the Ofoden,
the Ulf, the Lyngen, the Quananger, or the Alten
fjords." I took my map out. After a conference it
was agreed that we should go to the Ulf fjord.</p>

<p>Norway is the country of fjords. A fjord is an
arm of the sea, winding its way far inland in the midst
of mountains. The sea is very deep, often of greater
depth than the towering heights which rise abruptly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
from the shore, though these are often several thousand
feet in altitude. No road can be built along many of
these fjords, and boats are the conveyances that are
used to go from one place to another.</p>

<p>"There are houses of refuge in the mountains,
where we shall find shelter in case of heavy storms,"
said the Lapps. "If it were not for those places
of refuge people would often perish when overtaken
by these storms. Paulus, you have met great
windstorms on your way here, but they are nothing
to compare with the terrific winds to be met in the
high mountains. Remember that we are in the month
of March&mdash;the month of storms."</p>

<p>As I was listening to what the Lapps said, I thought
I heard, from across the Atlantic, my young folks and
friends encouraging me, crying: "Be not afraid, Paul.
Go on! Go on! No harm will befall you!" I
shouted back, "I am not afraid!"</p>

<p>So we started. First we came to a Finn hamlet,
where we met a good many Finlanders and Laplanders
who had arrived with their goods and a great
many sleighs and reindeer on their way to the Ulf
fjord. All the animals had been trained to eat reindeer
moss gathered and stored for that purpose. We had
come just in time.</p>

<p>Here it was agreed that Jakob and the Lapps who
had taken me to this place should not go further, but
that I should be taken care of by Finlanders, whose
destination was the same as mine and who were
on their way to the Arctic Sea. I was to go with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
John Puranen. John was a powerfully built man,
with a very kind expression.</p>

<p>We were soon good friends. John and a party of
friends were going with a large number of sleighs
loaded with reindeer meat, butter, reindeer cheese,
smoked tongues, skins, garments, shoes, and thousands
of frozen ptarmigans, to sell to the people living
on the coast.</p>

<p>The day after our coming parties of Finlanders
and Laplanders began to leave, with forty or fifty
sleighs and a number of spare reindeer in case any
gave out.</p>

<p>As I looked over the snow, I could see the caravans
following each other, in single file, and a number
of dogs following their masters.</p>

<p>The next day we started with a large party. We
all hoped for good weather. We took a good supply
of reindeer moss with us.</p>

<p>Late at night we came to the first farm of refuge
found in our track. Hundreds of sleighs and reindeer
were outside, and when I entered the house more
than a hundred men were sleeping on the floor. The
snoring was something terrific, and the heat and the
closeness of the room were unbearable. A lighted
lamp shone dimly on the slumberers.</p>

<p>So I thought that I would be far more comfortable
sleeping outside in my two bags. John said that he
would sleep in his bags by me&mdash;and in fact we slept
very comfortably.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/017.png" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="" />
"The mist was so thick that I could not see ahead."</div>

<p>When I awoke in the morning it was 42 degrees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
below zero. Then we went into the house and had
some coffee and reindeer meat for breakfast. As at
all the post stations, there is a tariff for everything
printed on the walls, so no overcharge is practised.</p>

<p>Many of the people had already left; we hurried
on to overtake them, and as usual went in single file.</p>

<p>The weather had become windy, and the wind blew
stronger and stronger as we went on, until there was
hardly any snow left on the ground. It flew to a
great height, and the mist was so thick that I could
not see ahead. My reindeer was going of its own
accord. I trusted him to scent and follow the other
reindeer ahead of me. I hurried him on by striking
slightly his right flank with my rein, hoping to overtake
the people of our party.</p>

<p>The wind kept increasing, and seeing no one ahead
or behind I became alarmed.</p>

<p>Where were John and the other fellows? I had
no provisions with me. Where was I? Once in a
while, when there was a lull that lasted about a
minute, I saw nothing but huge mountains ahead of
me. At sight of them I became more anxious than
ever. I could only hear the shrieking of the wind,
which at times threatened to upset me. Occasionally
it blew so hard that my reindeer had to stop.</p>

<p>My head was entirely hidden by my mask and my
hood, which had been made so secure that I felt it
would stay with my head till both were blown away.
Only my eyes could be seen; but the snow which
kept flying in the air became as fine as flour and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
penetrated everywhere. It got through the open
space for my eyes, then gathered on my hair, eyelashes,
eyebrows, and mustache, and on my cheeks
and nose; in fact, everywhere on my face, and made
a mask of ice.</p>

<p>I wished I had no mustache, no eyebrows, no eyelashes,
no hair&mdash;for it was very painful every time I
broke this mask of ice. It was hardly broken when it
would form again from the particles of new snow
adhering to each other. When I broke it, I thought
every hair would be torn from my face. If I had
not cleared it away the mask of ice would have become
so thick that I would have been unable to see. I
began to think that there was no fun crossing the
mountains after all, if this was the weather we were
going to get all the way.</p>

<p>As I could not overtake the people ahead, and
John was not in sight, gloomy thoughts came over me.
Suppose I can find nobody, nor even a house of
refuge, I repeated: what then? What will become
of me in this terrific windstorm, in the midst of these
great towering mountains that surround me on every
side? An answer to my question, as dark as my
thought, said: "Starvation! Starvation! Death!
Death!"</p>

<p>Suddenly I thought I heard, through the storm,
the same voice from the friends at home shouting to
me, "Be of good cheer, Paul; go on; go on! No
harm will befall you!"</p>

<p>These imaginary words had hardly been uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
when I said to myself, "If the worst comes to the
worst, and when I am on the point of starving, I will
kill my reindeer, drink its warm blood to sustain my
life, abandon my sleigh, and depend on my skees.
By that time the storm may be over, and I may meet
some of the people who were with me, or other parties
who are going to the Arctic Sea."</p>

<p>Soon after I had reached this decision, however, I
saw through the mist something black. Was it a pack
of hungry wolves? It was moving towards me. I
seized my gun; but how could I shoot in such
weather and be sure to kill? I did not fancy the
idea of being attacked by a pack of hungry and starving
wolves. At any rate, I would make a desperate
effort to kill some; these would be eaten by the pack,
and after they were satisfied they would perhaps not
follow me but let me alone. Perhaps I might kill a
wolf and suck his warm blood; this would avoid the
need of killing my reindeer.</p>

<p>No, they were not wolves, but people! I was in
the midst of my friends; they had stopped and were
waiting for me.</p>

<p>Now I felt happy. John's dog also felt happy
for he wagged his tail and looked at me, and John
said, "Paulus, if you had been lost, my dog would
have found you."</p>

<p>Then they exclaimed: "We would never have
gone to the sea without you. We would have wandered
all over the mountains with our reindeer or on
our skees to find you. But we thought your reindeer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
would follow our track, for he could scent ours, as the
wind was in the right direction; and here we were
waiting for you." I could hardly hear their voices,
though they surrounded me, for they were drowned
in the hissing of the wind.</p>

<p>We continued our way and came to another house
of refuge, where we took shelter. There we could
wait until the storm was over.</p>

<p>It was so nice to stretch one's legs and to stand
up and pace the floor and bring the blood into
circulation.</p>

<p>What would the people do while travelling in such
a climate without houses of refuge? The place of
refuge was a mountain farm; they had cows, goats, and
sheep, for there were pastures near by in summer.</p>

<p>When the time to sleep came I stretched myself at
full length upon a reindeer skin on the floor, and fell
asleep hearing the wind howling fiercely round the
house.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning the storm had
ceased. I washed my face and hands in water and
dried them with a clean towel which the wife handed
me. What a luxury!</p>

<p>After breakfast we bade the kind people of the
house of refuge good-bye, and once more we were on
our way to the Arctic Sea. We had not been two
hours on the way, however, when the sky began to
grow gray and apparently a storm was coming; the
wind increased, and flakes of snow began to fall; the
squalls increased in force and frequency. Little did I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
know that these were the forerunners of a series of
great windstorms that were to take place nearly five
thousand feet above the sea. In a word, I was to
encounter the greatest windstorms I have ever met in
my life. The dark clouds kept flying very fast high
over our heads, then at times seemed to be hardly
above the top of the mountains. The sky became wild
and peculiar. John was hurrying his reindeer as fast as
he could by striking his flanks. He evidently knew
what was coming, for he was a child of the stormy
regions of the North, and knew what such a threatening
sky meant in March. The wind was increasing
in force every minute, the snow flew thicker in the
air. At last, when we reached the station of refuge,
John gave a great shout of satisfaction. We had come
just in time. The snow was driven in thick clouds,
the hills and mountains were hidden from view, and
all around was nothing but a thick haze. The fur of
our garments was entirely filled with particles of snow;
we looked as if we had been rolled in a barrel of
flour.</p>

<p>I gave a great sigh of relief when we came in front
of the house of refuge. It was well that we hurried
with all our might, for we would never have reached
the place at a slower speed. Then what would have
become of John and me, and of the others!</p>

<p>At bedtime reindeer skins were strewn on the floor,
for many had come to get shelter against the furious
windstorm. Before going to sleep, we took off our
shoes, and carefully hung them with our stockings and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Lapp grass on the poles that were suspended near the
ceiling. Then we bade each other good-night and
thanked the farmer and his wife for their kindness.</p>

<p>That night I dreamed that the same voices that I
had heard before were saying to me, "Go on! Go on!
Friend Paul, no harm will befall you. Do not be afraid,
be valiant, as you were in Africa. Then come back
and tell us what you have seen in 'The Land of the
Long Night.'" Thereupon I saw all their faces smiling
at me. I felt so happy during that sleep. But it was
nothing but a sweet dream. When I awoke there
was nothing round me to remind me of my far-away
friends, of the girls and boys I loved so dearly.
"What makes you, Paul, so fond of a wandering life,"
I said to myself, "and of encountering such perils and
hardships as you have done all through your life, when
you have so many warm friends at home?"</p>

<p>In the morning, one by one, the people awoke and
got up. The weather was calm, but John said: "The
weather is not to be trusted at this time of the year on
these high mountains." I had great faith in John,
as a weather prophet.</p>

<p>Most people had their provisions with them. I
was to drink my coffee in the finest cup owned by the
owners of the house of refuge. "Taste some of my
butter," a Finlander would say. "Taste my smoked
reindeer meat," urged a Laplander. "Help yourself
to some of my cheese," said a third. If I had eaten
a little of all that was offered, I should not have been
able to travel. People must not eat too much when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
they have plenty of exercise to perform, or hard
work to do.</p>

<p>After breakfast John said to me: "It is wise in
these mountains to prepare for all kinds of weather.
It has been bad enough already, but it may be a great
deal worse, for to-day the mountains we are to cross
are very high."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" I exclaimed. "Is it possible
that we can have worse weather than we have seen,
John?" "Certainly," he replied. I wondered what
sort of weather it could be!</p>

<p>John attended himself to my toilet; he would not
trust me. He put my stockings on, put an extra
quantity of Lapp grass round them, and saw that
every part of my foot to my ankle was well protected,
tied the shoes over my ankles and my reindeer-skin
trousers most carefully, saw that my belt was well
fastened, that my "pesh" or fur blouse was carefully
made fast round my neck, and that my gloves were
well secured to my wrists with bands used for that
purpose and my hood tied tightly. When he had
finished, he said, with a smile:</p>

<p>"Paulus, you are ready to stand the strongest windstorm
that can blow; everything on your body is
made as secure as it can be!"</p>

<p>Our reindeer being harnessed we bade good-bye to
the people of the house of refuge, and a number of
parties left together for self-protection.</p>

<p>John was not mistaken about the weather. Three
or four hours after our departure the wind increased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and terrific squalls followed each other and threatened
to upset our sleighs. The blinding snow dust prevented
my seeing my reindeer, and at times I could
not even see the head of my sleigh. Night seemed to
have taken the place of daylight,&mdash;a thick fog could
not have been worse. Then, to add to my discomfort,
I had continually to break through the mask of ice,
which formed again quickly after being broken. It
was of no use to look for the furrows of the sleighs
that had preceded us, for their tracks were filled at
once with snow.</p>

<p>Once more I thought I was lost, when I saw John
standing still; he was waiting for me, and attached my
sleigh to his, so that the mishap of being parted again
could not occur. When he had tied the two sleighs,
he said: "If we are lost we will be together." Dear
John, what a glorious fellow he was!</p>

<p>I thought of what I imagined the "Long Night"
had said to me after the disappearance of the sun: "I
send terrific gales and mighty snowstorms upon ocean
and lands." It seemed to me that I could hear her
sardonic laugh after telling me of her power. The
storm continued to increase, and swept down upon us
from the higher mountain sides with a force which I
had never witnessed before, though I have crossed the
Atlantic more than twenty times in winter and met
with furious gales.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/018.png" width="600" height="385" alt="" title="" />
"We remained seated on the ground, back to back."</div>

<p>When I thought that it was impossible for the wind
to blow stronger, the next squall proved that it could.
Then we fell in with a number of men of the party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
They had stopped; they did not dare to go further,
travelling had become impossible; before we knew it
we might fall over a precipice, or go in the wrong
direction. I managed to look at my thermometer.
It was 17 degrees below zero. I wished it had been
forty or forty-five, for instead of a windstorm we should
then have had glorious still weather.</p>

<p>The wind had risen to such a pitch that no snow
was left on the ground, though in many places it must
have been twenty or thirty feet deep or more. It was
all flying in the air, and though it was noon it was
quite dark. We remained seated on the ground, back
to back, in order to support each other, with our heads
bent, to prevent as far as possible the snow getting
under our masks. It was a weird sight, as once in a
while I could see dimly through the flying snow our
bent, immovable bodies, with heads down. Not a
man said a word; it seemed as if we were frozen to
death.</p>

<p>The snow was carried hither and thither, and all at
once in a lull of a few seconds fell, forming hillocks,
which were in an instant destroyed and sent flying in
the air. One of these hillocks settled dangerously
near us and scared us.</p>

<p>Then one of the men suggested that we had better
divide into two parties, so that in case one should be
buried in the snow, the other party could help to extricate
those who were buried. This suggestion was
accepted at once. As we got up several of the men were
taken off their feet, and rolled over against some sleighs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
which stopped them. I was raised bodily and thrown
on the ground, and carried away; but some of the
men came to my rescue and caught me. Finally we
succeeded in making two parties; we were about fifty
yards from each other and ready to help one another
in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The wind became so terrific that we had to crouch
against the rocks. I thought we must be in the heart
of "The Land of the Wind," and that this was the worst
country I had ever come to. I almost believed that
the wind had obtained the mastery over the world,
and chaos was coming again. But after a few hours
these north-west squalls gradually diminished in intensity,
and for a time the windstorm seemed to be
over. Then we made preparations to continue our

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>A Dangerous Descent.&mdash;How to Descend the Mountains.&mdash;The
most Perilous Portion of the Journey.&mdash;Exhaustion
of the Reindeer.&mdash;All Safe at the Bottom.&mdash;Arrival
at the Shore of the Arctic Sea.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AS we were ready to start, John said to me:
"Paulus, we are soon to come to the most
dangerous part of the journey; we are to descend the
western slopes of the mountains, which at times are
very abrupt, to the sea. We will go over mountain
tops and descend their steep declivities. We shall
have to drive twice along the sides of deep ravines; all
that are here are going together, so that we may help
each other. Get into your sleigh and follow us closely.
I will lead, and my brother will be behind you."</p>

<p>We set forth, and soon afterwards I noticed that
our reindeer went much faster than at the start. I
knew by this that we were approaching the slope of a
mountain. I was right. Next we came to the brink
of a hill, and descended with a rapidity of at least
twenty-five miles an hour. The animals simply flew.</p>

<p>When my reindeer reached the bottom of the hill
he made the usual sudden curve to the left to keep
the sleigh, which had a tremendous momentum, from
striking against his legs. I had prepared myself for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the sudden motion; I had been there before! I bent
my body almost out of the sleigh in the opposite
direction, and succeeded in keeping in. It was a fine
sight to see sleigh after sleigh coming down the hill,
but no man followed exactly in the track of the others,
so that in case of accident the one behind would not
pitch headlong into the sleigh ahead.</p>

<p>I thought this was lots of fun. But ascending the
hill on the opposite side was no fun at all. It was
indeed hard work for the reindeer and for the men.
The snow had drifted on one side of the hill and was
very deep, and in many places very soft. The poor
reindeer spread their hoofs as wide as they could, so
as not to sink too deeply. But in many places it was
of no avail; they would sink to their flanks and even
deeper; but it was wonderful to see how quickly they
sprang out.</p>

<p>We should never have been able to ascend the hill
without going in zigzag. We had often to get out of
our sleighs and take to our skees. One Finn lent me
a pair of them that were much shorter than mine, to
ascend the hills. I should never have been able to
do it had I not followed the track of those ahead.
Though it was 43 degrees below zero, I was in a profuse
perspiration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/019.png" width="395" height="550" alt="" title="" />
"Once in a while I gave a look towards the ugly precipice."</div>

<p>At times the poor reindeer panted; their tongues
protruded. They would fall down on their backs,
breathing heavily. My reindeer was so exhausted
and breathed so hard, with protruding tongue and
mouth wide open, that I thought he was going to die.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
"Don't be afraid," said John to me with a smile, as
he saw my anxious face, "reindeer often act like this
when they are exhausted; yours will soon be all
right."</p>

<p>John was not mistaken.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how quickly they all recovered,
and after eating plenty of snow they went on as if
nothing had happened to them, until they again became
exhausted and powerless. When we reached
the top of a mountain, we waited for those of our
party that lagged behind. I said to John, "I hope
we have not many more of these hills to ascend."
"We have none so steep; but, Paulus, now we have
come to the most dangerous part of our whole journey;
we are going to run along the brink of one of the
ravines of which I spoke to you. Look ahead," said
he, pointing to the deep ravine.</p>

<p>When all the men of our party had arrived at the
top of the hill, every one began to make careful preparations
for the descent, and I watched with great
earnestness what was done. Once in a while I gave a
look towards the ugly precipice. I did not like the
sight a bit. The men were anxious, and showed this
in the care and pains they took in testing every plaited
leather cord, and those were especially strong that were
to be used for such an emergency. They knew how
dangerous was the ride and that no cord must snap.</p>

<p>A number of sleighs were lashed with mine by a
very strong plaited leather cord. When John was
through he said to me: "This cord cannot break."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind each sleigh a reindeer was fastened, the cord
being attached at the base of his horns. John said to
me: "Reindeer cannot bear to be pulled quickly, and
make every effort to disengage themselves, and by
doing so act as a drag." All the sleighs had been
lashed together by fours, sixes, eights, or tens. We
had plenty of spare reindeer with us, and at the end of
each set of sleighs two or three reindeer were made
fast to the last one. A man was in the front sleigh of
the set to lead, and another man in the last one. John
was to lead the set in which I was, and his brother
was to be in the last. As usual each man rode his
sleigh with his legs outside, turned back somewhat, or
reversed, with the top of his shoes touching the snow,
the feet to act as rudder.</p>

<p>When I did the same a great cry went up. I heard,
"No! No! Paulus, your legs will surely be broken;
put them inside your sleigh, as you have always
done!" and before I could say a word in reply John
and a Finn were by me, each taking one of my legs
and putting it inside.</p>

<p>A short time was to elapse between the start of each
set of sleighs, so that there would be no chance of
their coming in contact. The signal was given, and one
set after another started with great speed. It was one
of the grandest and most dangerous sights I had ever
seen, but the Lapps and Finns were accustomed to
this, for they generally went twice every winter to the
Arctic Sea with their produce for sale.</p>

<p>Then my turn came. John started and off we went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sleighs swerved in the descent the tension was
very great. I said to myself, "If the cord that keeps
our sleighs together breaks we shall be pitched far below
and be dashed against the rocks with incredible
force."</p>

<p>In the mean time every reindeer was holding back
with all his power, making efforts to disengage himself,
and by doing this acted as a brake on the sleighs
in front. If they had not done so the descent would
have been impossible.</p>

<p>What speed! I had never seen anything like
this descent before. Here was a terrifying precipice,
the sloping rocks leading towards the chasm.
I was afraid the reindeer would miss their footing. I
hoped that no bare ice would be met. At any moment
we might have been thrown out headlong. After we
reached the dale, which closed abruptly at the head of
the ravine, I was breathless from excitement. I had
just ended one of two of the most exciting rides I had
ever taken. We waited for those that were behind,
and when they had arrived we rested for a while.</p>

<p>I asked John what would have happened if one of
the cords had snapped. He did not answer my question,
but simply looked at me with a serious expression.
I knew what it would have meant. Death!</p>

<p>Further on we had another descent of the same
character, but not so dangerous.</p>

<p>We were all glad when we reached the station of
refuge; we were so tired from the excitement of the
day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>We had crossed the backbone of the mountain, and
had come down the western slope. Each stream now
flowed to the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>The next day we continued the descent. The day
before we had come to the zone where the juniper
grew; to-day we passed the birch. Then came the
fir trees. Darkness overtook us, and I could not
make out what sort of land it was, but soon we came to
the house of a fisherman, where we all spent the night.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning and looked out I
found that I was at the bottom of a great chasm with
towering mountains on each side. I had never seen
the like. It seemed to me that I had come to a world
unknown before. Looking towards the west I saw a
long dark green line of water, sunk deeply into the
ragged and precipitous mountains. I had come to the
Ulf Fjord. The water was the Arctic Sea. I was on
the shores of grand old Norway.</p>

<p>The fjord was frozen at its inner extremity for
about one mile with thick solid ice. At the inner end
of every fjord there is a river, flowing through a valley,
which is the continuation of the fjord; consequently
the water is only brackish and freezes more easily than
salt water. Further on the fjord is free of ice, for in
this part of the world, though so far north, the sea is
made warm by the Gulf Stream, the very same Gulf
Stream that starts from West Africa and flows westward
to the coast of Brazil, then branches off northward
and runs close to our American shores. Without
the Gulf Stream this part of Norway would be a land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of ice, just as the land of North-west America is, in the
same latitude.</p>

<p>I remembered that I had sailed over the Gulf Stream
waters near the African coast, and it had come to meet
the same stream again on that far-away northern shore&mdash;beyond
the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>My journey over mountains 5,000 feet high, between
the 69th and 70th degrees of north latitude, was
over.</p>

<p>I saw a vessel in the distance, and with one of the
fishermen living on this inhospitable shore we went on
board. It was good luck the vessel was going to sail
north. The captain was willing to take me with him
on his voyage.</p>

<p>I thanked John and my other travelling companions
for the kindness they had shown me. We parted with
great tokens of friendship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Sail on the Arctic Ocean.&mdash;The Brig <i>Ragnild</i>.&mdash;&AElig;gir and
Ran, the God and Goddess of the Sea.&mdash;The Nine Daughters
of &AElig;gir and Ran.&mdash;Great Storms.&mdash;Compelled to
Heave to.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AS I stepped on board I said farewell to my dear
skees and sleigh, as they were put into the hold.
"I shall miss you very much," I said, "for we have
had happy times together." Then we sailed away.
Now I have laid aside my Lapp costume, and I am clad
in the garb of a fisherman. I am clothed in a suit of
oilskin garments, over my woollens, to protect me
from the wet. I wear a big sou'wester, instead of a
cap, to keep the rain and the spray from running down
my neck, and huge sea-boots to keep my legs and feet
dry. In these I am ready to brave the storms of the
Arctic Ocean. Now a boat will be my sleigh, its sail
my reindeer: these will carry me onward on the sea, as
the others have done on the snow.</p>

<p>As I stood quietly on deck looking at the sea, the
captain said to me, "For a wonder we have pleasant
weather. This winter we have had nothing but a
succession of gales or terrific squalls, and what is worse,
blinding snowstorms, when we could not even see each
other on deck."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">

"I am clad in the garb of a fisherman."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Ragnild</i>&mdash;such was the name of our vessel&mdash;was
a staunch Norwegian brig that had weathered many
a gale on the stormy coast of Norway and the Arctic
Sea. She was bound for the coast of Finmarken,
on the east side of North Cape, to buy codfish. On
board were provisions and clothing, boots, etc., for sale
to the fishermen we were to meet in the coast settlements.</p>

<p>Our crew was composed of most sturdy seafaring
men. The name of the captain was Ole Petersen, a
real old salt who had been at sea for nearly fifty
years and was part owner of the craft.</p>

<p>John Andersen was the first mate; the sailors were
Lars, Evert, Ivor, Hakon, Pehr, and Harald. All
of these men had encountered many a gale, and two
had been wrecked.</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock that evening, the captain and
I went to our bunks, the captain leaving the first mate
and three men on the watch.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning the <i>Ragnild</i> was rolling
heavily; we were in the midst of an angry sea and
of a great gale, and while I was dressing I was thrown
from one side of my little stateroom to the other,
and it was no fun. I came on deck, and as I looked
at the big waves I said, "The wind and the waves are
in their ugly mood." The wind howled and shrieked
through the rigging, and waves were like big hills. I
thought of the many wrecks of ships and boats, and of
the multitude of passengers and seafaring men that have
been drowned since people have sailed on the seas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain murmured to me, "This is ugly
weather indeed. We must employ all the skill we
have to fight against the storm. Our sails are new,
our rigging is strong, and our vessel is staunch, and
we are all valiant men on board who have gone
through many such a storm before."</p>

<p>That morning as I watched the coast, I remembered
that the Vikings believed and worshipped &AElig;gir as the
god of the sea. &AElig;gir ruled over the sea and the wind.
Ran was his wife, and she had a net in which she
caught all those who were lost at sea; her Hall was
at the bottom of the ocean, and there she welcomed
all the shipwrecked people.</p>

<p>&AElig;gir and Ran had nine daughters, and their names
were emblematic of the waves. They were called
<i>Hefring</i> the Hurling, <i>Hr&ouml;nn</i> the Towering, <i>Bylgja</i>
the Upheaving, <i>Bara</i> the Lashing.</p>

<p>The five other daughters were called <i>Himingl&aelig;fa</i> the
Heaven Glittering, <i>Bl&ouml;dughadda</i> the Bloody Haired,
<i>Kolga</i> the Cooling, <i>Unn</i> the Loving, <i>Dufa</i> the Dove.</p>

<p>The Vikings dreaded Hefring, Hr&ouml;nn, and Bylgja
when far out at sea, and Bara when they were approaching
the shore. These four waves are those the
mariners dread to-day.</p>

<p>They believed that these daughters of &AElig;gir and Ran
were seldom partial to men, that the wind awakened
them and made them angry and fierce. They called
them "The white-hooded daughters of &AElig;gir and
Ran." They called the spray their hair. They believed
that in calm weather they walked on the reefs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
wandered gently along the shores, and that their beds
were rocks, stone-heaps, pebbles, and sands.</p>

<p>I had not been long on the sea before I found
that I had exchanged the terrific winds of Arctic "Snow
Land" for the gales of the Arctic Ocean. The
weather was fearful! Snow, sleet, hurricanes, treacherous
heavy squalls, followed each other in succession.</p>

<p>"This is the winter weather we have here," said the
captain; "we do not expect any better at this time of
the year. When there is a lull, it is only to deceive
us; then it blows harder than ever, and the snow or
the sleet falls thicker than before."</p>

<p>My fancy recalled again to me the words of the
"Long Night": "I send terrific gales and mighty
snowstorms over oceans and lands."</p>

<p>As I looked at the ocean I saw a big towering wave
rolling up towards the stern of the ship and apparently
gaining upon us. It was transparent and of a deep
green color. I imagined I could see Hefring with
glittering eyes, one of her arms directing the wave
against us.</p>

<p>The men looked anxiously towards the wave, which
was steadily advancing, but our ship rode over it
as if she were a gull resting on the ocean. Then the
ugly wave formed a crest, curled upon itself, and
with a heavy boom broke into fragments of snowy
foam.</p>

<p>I said to the men: "This wave has missed us."
They answered in serious voices, "And we must watch,
for a more towering one will follow, as there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
always three of them going together, and this second
one may come and break over us."</p>

<p>These words were hardly uttered when I saw far
off another mountainous wave rolling up. I imagined it
was Hr&ouml;nn. It was so high as it neared us that we
could not see the horizon beyond; it looked fierce
and dangerous. Its crest gradually rose higher and
higher, as if getting ready to strike. Steadily Hr&ouml;nn
advanced. We are lost, and our ship is sure to
founder if her wave breaks over our stern. The faces of
the captain and men were serious. I said to myself:
"If we get into the whirlpool of its crest there will be
no escape; we are sure to founder."</p>

<p>The wave broke about fifty yards before reaching us.
It had become harmless, but the foaming, scattered
billows enveloped the ship in their thick spray. It was
a narrow escape; but we were saved thus far! Then
in the wake of the imaginary Hr&ouml;nn rose another wave.
I imagined Bylgja was coming. It advanced slowly
and angrily towards us, ready to sweep our deck and
to do the work the two others had tried to do and
missed&mdash;demolish our ship. It broke before reaching
us with a loud boom, making the sea a surging
sheet of foam as white as snow for a long distance.
This was a beautiful sight. We gave a great shout
of joy; we had had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>After these three heavy seas came a lull. The
captain said thoughtfully, "Those are the waves that
disable or founder ships and send them to the bottom
of the sea!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/021.png" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="" />
"I saw a big towering wave rolling towards the stern of the ship."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>We were indeed still in the midst of a great gale.
But the captain and our crew had thus far fought
against the storm successfully. I thought of the great
Viking Half, and of his champions. It was their
custom always to lie before capes, never to put up a
tent on board, and never to reef a sail in a storm.
Half had never more than sixty men on board of his
ship, nor could any one go with him who was not so
hardy that he never was afraid or changed countenance
on account of his wounds. I wondered if Half
and his men had ever encountered such a storm as we
were having. If so his ship must have been a staunch
vessel indeed.</p>

<p>As the hours passed the storm continued, the
Daughters of &AElig;gir and Ran rose again and again, trying
to strike our ship; when their hoods were rent
asunder, their long hair streamed on the gale.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the dark clouds were lower than
usual and moved rapidly over our heads. The wind
howled and hissed through the rigging. Wave after
wave struck against the ship's side and deluged the deck
with water. One of them took me off my feet and
pitched me to the other side against the bulwarks,
almost washing me overboard.</p>

<p>"You had better go into the cabin," said the captain;
"this is no weather for you." But I replied,
"Yes, captain, it is; I want to see this big storm
with its mighty sea." I had hardly said these words
when another wave came aboard of us. Two men
were nearly washed overboard; fortunately they held
fast to the rigging.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after another big wave struck our port side,
and carried away a part of our bulwarks, swamping
our decks with a huge mass of water; this time nearly
washing overboard all of us who were on deck. Looking
at the havoc the wave had wrought, I remembered
the saga which tells of the storm the celebrated Viking
Fridthjof encountered at sea, and which says:</p>

<p>"Then came a wave breaking so strongly that it
carried away the gunwales and part of the bow, and
flung four men overboard, who were lost.</p>

<p>"'Now it is likely,' said Fridthjof, 'that some of
our men will visit Ran. We shall not be thought fit
to go there unless we prepare ourselves well. I
think it is right that every man should carry some
gold with him!' He cut asunder the arm ring of
his sweetheart Ingibj&ouml;rg, and divided it among his
men."</p>

<p>We had been running before the wind with all the
sails we could carry safely, so that the ship might not
be overtaken and swamped. As long as the ship
can sail faster or quite as fast as the waves, it is all
right; but if the waves go faster then there is great
danger that the ship will be pooped by the sea,&mdash;that
is, that the seas may come over the stern, and sweep over
the deck, carrying everything away. In such a case it
happens sometimes that all those who are on deck
are swept overboard.</p>

<p>The sea finally became so high and so threatening
that the captain ordered that we should heave to and
wait for the storm to abate. To heave a ship to before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the wind is a dangerous man&#339;uvre. We waited until
three big seas had passed. There is generally a lull
after that, and then is the time to bring the ship's head
to the wind. During the evolution the ship is liable
to get in the trough of the sea, when she rolls heavily,
and has her deck swept by the waves. The dangerous
operation in our case proved successful.</p>

<p>While our ship lay to we had just sail enough to
keep her head to the wind, and she rode like a big
albatross on the water, drifting a little to leeward.
When she was in the hollow of two waves, these
seemed like mountains ready to engulf us, but we
rode safely over every one. As we lay to we felt
perfectly secure. Our ship did not roll as if broadside
to the seas, but pitched, rising slowly, over every
wave.</p>

<p>After lying to for over six hours, the storm having
somewhat moderated, we sailed east towards the
shore; but before the day was over we encountered
a cross-sea, the waves coming in every direction and
striking against each other. The man at the helm had
to watch them. Evidently there had been two or three
heavy storms blowing in different directions. A cross-sea
is very dangerous, for the man at the helm never
knows where the wave will strike. After a while the
wind shifted and was ahead, and now we had to beat
against it and we sailed under close reefed sails. The
wind seemed ten times stronger than before, for when
a ship runs before the wind, the wind is not felt so
much, as it goes with the ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>As we came to a barren island, running parallel with
the main land, we saw the angry sea lashing itself with
a tremendous force against the solid base of mountain
walls, filling the air each time it struck with a deep
booming sound which seemed like the roar of cannon
heard far off; the waves, as they struck the immovable
wall of rocks which stopped their advance,
breaking into a tumultuous mass of seething billows,
which recoiled from the barrier that opposed them and
fell back into a surging, boiling mass of white which
soon after was hurled forward again by another advancing
wave rushing on to meet the same fate. The
whole coast was fringed as far as the eye could see with
a mass of angry white billows. It was an awful sight.</p>

<p>Seamen dread the coast in a storm more than they
do the waves in the middle of the ocean. We steered
for the leeward of the island, and when we reached the
sound separating it from the main land we came into
smooth water where we cast anchor. We were to
remain there until the storm abated, to give a good
rest to the crew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>A Dark Night at Sea.&mdash;Wake of the <i>Ragnild</i>.&mdash;Thousands
of Phosphorescent Lights.&mdash;A Light Ahead.&mdash;An Arctic
Fair.&mdash;A Fishing Settlement.&mdash;How the Cod are cured.&mdash;Fish
and Fertilizer Fragrance.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE weather having moderated, we raised our
anchor and with a fair wind continued our
voyage. When the night came it was so pitch-dark
that I could not distinguish the sea from the horizon
and the sky. It was impressive. I felt so little in
the immensity that surrounded our craft. Our ship,
to my eyes, when compared with the size of the ocean,
was not bigger than a tiny hazelnut tossed to and fro
upon it.</p>

<p>Once in a while the crest of a wave broke into a
long snowy-white line which appeared to be filled with
a thousand lights; this effect was caused by the
infinite number of animalcul&aelig;, which are struck
together by the movement of the wave and give out
phosphorescence. These animalcul&aelig; are living creatures
which cannot be seen without the help of the
microscope. It is wonderful that such small things
can give such glowing light.</p>

<p>The long heavy swells, pushed by the southerly
gales that had passed away, moved irresistibly on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
towards the North, one after another, to break the
wall of ice the Long Night had built round the pole.
What terrific booming must take place there at
times, when the ice gives way, breaks up, and rises in
great ridges over the Long Wall!</p>

<p>A light at our masthead told of our presence to the
mariners of the fishing boats, or the vessels coming
from far northern ports across our course, and warned
them of danger.</p>

<p>Our ship ploughed her way through the sea, raising
a mass of foam brilliant with globules of light. These
globules swept astern along the sides of the ship, and
disappeared further on. We left behind us an undulating
luminous wake, resembling a long bright snake
following us, which was gradually in the distance engulfed
by the ocean. This luminous track seemed to
be reeled off from a windlass at the stern of the ship.</p>

<p>As I watched this white serpentine phosphorescent
pathway, I thought of the countless wakes that had
been made in like manner since vessels sailed upon
the seas, on their way to different lands, for thousands
of years past, yet not one of those tracks has ever
been seen again. No wonder that the Norsemen
called the sea "The Hidden Path."</p>

<p>On deck were four men on the watch, who guarded
the lives of those who had gone below to sleep. The
man at the helm watched the compass, which was
lighted by a lamp. A man at the prow was on the
lookout for sudden danger&mdash;ships, derelicts, or rocks.
Another stood amidships. The first mate paced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
deck, watching for any change in the wind. Suddenly
the man at the prow shouted:</p>

<p>"Light on the starboard bow!" It was the light
of a ship sailing in the opposite direction towards us.
In a snowstorm, in a fog, we might have collided;
then both might have gone to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>To the leeward of us was the barren, forbidding coast;
to the windward lay rocky islands. "Dear compass,"
I whispered, "we trust in thee; lead us right; the
night is very dark, and our eyes cannot see rocks
ahead, except, perchance, when it is too late."</p>

<p>Suddenly the bell struck: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. It was midnight&mdash;time for
the watch below to relieve the one on duty, and for
the captain to take the place of the mate. Every four
hours this change is made. I remained on deck, for
I wanted to watch this dark night.</p>

<p>I came on deck early the next morning, for I
smothered in the close confined cabin&mdash;I had been so
accustomed to the bracing open air. As I looked
around me I saw nothing but the great horizon which
surrounded us. It had seemed so near every day, as
we sailed towards it, and yet, no matter how long we
sailed, we never came nearer. This was because the
horizon is the boundless space in the midst of which
the earth moves on its axis round the sun.</p>

<p>In the morning we came to a place full of people
dressed in furs. They were Laplanders and Finlanders.
A great fair was taking place, and most of
the people had crossed the mountains to the Arctic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Sea, taking with them for sale reindeer meat, butter,
cheese, reindeer cheese made in the summer and
autumn, frozen ptarmigans, skins of reindeer, bears,
foxes, ermines, and other animals; ready-made clothing,
gloves and shoes of reindeer skin; hoofs of reindeer,
and other things. They bought salted and dried
codfish, sugar, coffee, salt, and other groceries, flour,
lamp oil, tobacco, and things for their wives and children,
and took back cash with them.</p>

<p>After a short stay we raised our anchor, and continued
to sail along that bleak coast until we came to
a hidden harbor, well protected by a number of barren
islands from the storms of the Arctic Ocean, and cast
anchor before a large fishing settlement. It was the
beginning of April.</p>

<p>It was a strange place indeed. The port was filled
with fishing boats. Hundreds of them were drawn
up on the shore, and other hundreds were at anchor.
There were also a number of good-sized vessels and
smaller craft. All along the rocky shore were huge piles
of codfish caught that day. The water was crowded
with boats moving in every direction, loaded with cod.</p>

<p>Alongside the big piles of fish, men dressed in wide
trousers and overalls of leather were busy preparing
the codfish. Some were cutting the heads off and
throwing them into a pile, while others were opening
the fish, cleaning them, and then, after flattening
them, throwing them to other men, who salted them.
After this operation they were carried to the warehouses
and were ready for drying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>By some of the piles men opened and cleaned the
fish and tied them together by twos. After this they
were hung on frames or poles. In other places the
men divided the cod in halves, taking their spines out,
but kept them connected by their gills. These were
also hung on the poles. When dry the fish is as hard
as wood.</p>

<p>The eggs or ova were put into barrels and salted,
and Captain Ole Petersen, who was with me, said to
me: "Each barrel contains the ova of three hundred
cod. They are sent to Italy and France and used in
the sardine fisheries of those countries." Other men
were busy putting the livers into barrels, two barrels
of fat liver yielding about one barrel of brown oil.
The tongues of the cod were taken out of the heads,
put into barrels and salted.</p>

<p>I visited the warehouses, built partly on piles projecting
into the sea. Along some of these were brigs
and schooners loading.</p>

<p>What a sight was the inside of these warehouses!
They were filled with long deep rows of freshly salted
codfish, piled higher than a man and about the same
width. These fish were to be put on board ships
and landed upon rocks, there to stay until they were
dried and ready to be shipped to foreign countries.
The cod is the gold of the people living on this desolate
land.</p>

<p>The country around was covered with frames upon
which fish were hanging. Nets and lines were seen
in every direction on the rocks, left to dry or ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
be mended. Wherever I turned the place was saturated
with the blood of fish and offal. The sea was
covered with offal; thousands of gulls were flying
in every direction and feeding upon it, while great
numbers of eider ducks, as tame as farm ducks, were
swimming everywhere and feeding. They were not
afraid, for no one is allowed to shoot them. The bare
rocks were black with hundreds of thousands of heads
of cod that had been put there to dry.</p>

<p>These heads, with the bones of fish, are turned into
a fertilizer, or used to feed cattle. The heads are
boiled before they are given to the animals. "Cattle
and sheep feeding on dried fish heads!" I exclaimed
with astonishment to my companion, "I never heard
of this before."</p>

<p>I asked one of the merchants how he could live in
such a place. "The atmosphere that brings money,"
he replied, "never smells bad. Where there is no
smell there is no business and no money with us."</p>

<p>Goodness gracious! what a smell there was in this
fishing settlement. It was far from pleasant, especially
when compared with the pure air of the land over
which I had travelled.</p>

<p>Several nice houses belonged to the merchants of
the place. These were painted white and were very
comfortable.</p>

<p>The cabins of the fishermen were scattered everywhere
and were all alike. They were built of logs,
with roofs covered with earth. I wanted to live with
the fishermen and become acquainted with them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Among the Fishermen.&mdash;Their Lodgings and how They Look.&mdash;What
They Have to Eat.&mdash;An Evening of Talk about
Cod, Salmon, and Herring.&mdash;The Immense Number of
Fish.&mdash;A Snoring Match.</p></div>


<p class="cap">SOON after Captain Petersen and I entered one of
the houses of the fishermen. They had just returned
from their fishing. I asked them if I could live with
them for a few days. "Yes," they all replied with
one voice. They knew Captain Petersen, I was with
him: that was enough for them.</p>

<p>Strange indeed was the room. Each fisherman's
cabin had only one. The wall was surrounded by two
rows of bunks, on top of each other. The room was
arranged like the forecastle of a ship.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" one of the fishermen
asked me.</p>

<p>"From America," I replied.</p>

<p>"From America!" they all exclaimed at once. "Is
that possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is from America," said Captain Petersen.</p>

<p>"I have a brother in America, in Minnesota," exclaimed
one.</p>

<p>A second said: "I have a sister in Dakota."</p>

<p>A third: "I also have a brother in America; he sails
on the Great Lakes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>From that moment those fishermen and I were great
friends. They asked me my name. I replied, "My
name is Paul Du Chaillu."</p>

<p>"Why!" some of the younger fishermen said, "we
have read in school the translation of your travels in
Africa. Are you really he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight men, the crews of four boats, including
the captains, lived together. A cooking-stove was
in the centre of the room; a few wooden benches and
a table composed the rest of the furniture, while a
number of chests contained the garments of the men,
several coffee kettles, a pan and a big pot, etc.</p>

<p>All these twenty-eight men insisted that I should
have a whole bunk to myself&mdash;the occupant would
shift and go to another fellow. I must be comfortable,
they said. I was not accustomed to living in
their way.</p>

<p>A man took his things from his bunk. He was
the captain of one of the boats. He said to me: "Paul,
my bunk is yours." I had to accept.</p>

<p>When they had cooked their meal, they said:
"Paul, eat with us simple fisher folk; we will give
you the best we have; you are welcome." We had
only one dish, and it was entirely new to me.</p>

<p>It was what the sailors called lobscouse, a sort of
pudding made of ship biscuits, liver, and fish. I did
not care much for it, but I said nothing to the fishermen.
One said: "We eat this dish every day, and that
will be your food when you are with us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph!" I said to myself. I remembered the
elephants, the crocodiles, the snakes, and the monkeys,
etc., I had had to eat while in Africa. The monkeys
when fat were fine, and tasted so good I should have
been willing to exchange a dish of lobscouse for a
monkey.</p>

<p>After our meal we had coffee; each man owned his
own cup. "We drink only coffee," they said, "for
no spirits are allowed to be sold here, for fear some
of the men while going to sea might become drunk,
and endanger their lives, and the lives of those that
are with them."</p>

<p>Our coffee drunk, we talked first about fish and their
peculiar habits. The names of the four captains were
John Ericksen, Hakon Johansen, Ole Larsen, Harald
Andersen.</p>

<p>"Every spring," said Captain Ole, "salmon come
up from the sea and ascend our rivers to spawn, and
in time the little ones go to sea. As they grow up
they continue to come every year to the same river
where they were born, and nobody knows where they
spend the interval."</p>

<p>After a pause, during which the fishermen filled
their pipes, Captain Ericksen said: "Every year the
codfish make their appearance in winter in vast shoals
and countless millions on the Lofoden Islands banks to
spawn. Then they migrate further north to the coast
of Finmarken, then eastward as far as Russia. Then
they disappear until the following winter. No one
knows where they come from or where they go."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the men observed: "I have been a fisherman
for over forty years, and it is wonderful how
regularly the cod make their appearance on the fishing
banks. We depend so much on their time of coming
that we leave home every year at the same date.
They must know their way in the ocean and recognize
different marks on their journey, for they have to
travel thousands of miles before they return to the
fishing banks to spawn. The cod in their migration
leave behind them a great many stragglers, which
are caught all the year round. The number of cod
caught on the banks of Finmarken and of the Lofoden
Islands averages about forty to forty-two millions a
year, and the total catch along the coasts of Norway
amounts to about fifty millions a year. The land is
barren, and if it were not for the fish we could not
live in our country."</p>

<p>"Fifty millions of cod is a great number," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "but these fifty millions are
nothing but a small fraction compared with the great
number that are not caught."</p>

<p>After our talk on the cod was finished, Captain
Ericksen spoke about herrings as follows: "If the
number of codfish caught is great, the number of
herring is far greater. The herrings make their appearance
in immense shoals, and it is beyond the power
and calculation of man to guess their number, for their
millions are countless. The migration of the herring
is often very irregular. They appear generally from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
January to March. The herring are known to have
disappeared for years in some districts, then suddenly
reappear."</p>

<p>"That is strange," I said. "Can you account for
that?"</p>

<p>"No," the captain replied; "if I were a herring I
probably could tell." We all laughed when he said
this.</p>

<p>I remarked: "The number of Norwegian fishing
boats is so great, how do you know when some are
missing and have foundered at sea?"</p>

<p>Captain Ericksen replied: "Every fishing district
has its own letter on each boat belonging to it, and a
number, and the name of every man composing its
crew is registered; also his residence, the day of his
birth, etc. This is necessary, for every year some
poor fisherman's boat is lost and the crew drowned;
thus the boat and crew missing can be identified.
All the Norwegian men you see at the fisheries have
homes&mdash;humble it is true&mdash;either on the fjords, by
the coast, or on some little islands where there are a few
patches of land which they can cultivate, raise potatoes
and some grain, and where there is grass enough to
keep a cow or two, sometimes more, some goats, and
a few sheep to give us wool.</p>

<p>"That is the reason you see us so warmly clad.
Our wives, daughters, or sisters, while we are absent
from home think of us. They spin and weave the
wool from our sheep into outer garments and underwear,
knit stockings for us, and with some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
money we get from our catch of fish we buy waterproof
clothing. With a good part of the money we
save we buy things for our family and the provisions
that we need, and put the rest in the bank."</p>

<p>It was time to retire, for we had to start up at five
in the morning, if the weather permitted, for the fishing
bank. It was agreed among the fishermen that I
should go net-fishing in the boat owned by Captain
Ole. What music we had during the night! All the
fishermen snored. I thought I had never heard such
a snoring before! I amused myself by wondering
which one of them would have received the prize had
it been a snoring match.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Departure for the Fishing Banks.&mdash;Great Number of Boats.&mdash;More
than Five Thousand Oars fall into the Water at
the Same Time.&mdash;Quantities of Buoys and Glass Balls.&mdash;A
Notable Catch of Cod.</p></div>


<p class="cap">AT four o'clock the next morning we were up. It
was the dawn of the day. It was wonderful how
quickly the nights shortened. Coffee, flat bread,
butter, and cheese made our breakfast.</p>

<p>When we came out almost all the boats with their
full crews were ready waiting for the hoisting of the
flag at five o'clock, which is the signal for the start, the
time changing according to the length of the day. We
all had to leave together, and to return the same day.
Every one, including myself, was dressed in oilskin
garments, sou'wester, and high sea-boots. There were
more than nine hundred fishing boats. As soon as
the flag was hoisted over five thousand oars struck the
water at the same time, and filled the air with a deep
booming sound. I had never seen so many sea boats
and oars together. It was a grand sight!</p>

<p>As soon as we were out of the harbor the boats
hoisted their sails, and soon we were scattered in every
direction, each boat going towards its buoys. I looked
at the thousands of white sails with wonder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Our fishing boat was a fine craft, forty-two feet
long and about seven feet and a half beam. The
poop was decked under for a cabin, with bunks for
the men to sleep in. The rudder-like oar, several feet
long, is held by the captain, who sculls and steers at
the same time.</p>

<p>Captain Ole was a regular "old salt." Our crew
was composed of Sven, Hakon, Fridthjof, Ivor,
Evert, Harald and Erik. Evert and Harald were
lads about seventeen years old; they were learning
to be hardy sailors like their father.</p>

<p>After a sail of three hours' beating against the wind,
we came to the fishing banks and towards our buoys.
The water for as far as I could see was filled with buoys
and glass balls (floaters to hold the nets) enclosed in
netted ropes. These glass balls were attached by a
short cord to the nets to keep them floating, while
stones at the bottom held the nets stretched. It was
no easy matter to sail among them.</p>

<p>Looking at the multitudes of buoys I asked Captain
Ole, "How can you ever find and recognize
your own buoys?"</p>

<p>He answered smiling, "We can find our nets by
the bearings, and every buoy has its special mark of
ownership. It is hard work to haul in the nets, especially
when the sea is rough. Each net is one hundred
and twenty fathoms long, and about three fathoms
deep;&mdash;we sailors do not count by yards but by
fathoms. Each fathom is six feet long. In our boat
we have to raise twenty-four nets tied together in
fours."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/022.png" width="600" height="386" alt="" title="" />
"It is hard work to haul in the nets."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will help you all I can," I replied; "I am willing
to work. I have come to sea and I am in your
boat as one of the crew, and I will try to do my part.
I hope we are going to have good luck, and that
the catch of cod will be big."</p>

<p>To Evert and Hakon was assigned the duty of
pulling in the nets. Two other men stowed the nets
carefully. Near the net-reels were two men who
hooked the fish as they appeared and threw them inside
of the boat, and another man and I arranged the
nets. How eager we were as the nets were hauled up
to peep and see how plentiful the fish were; for these
represented money&mdash;and the poor fishermen work so
hard to get a livelihood.</p>

<p>The sea was rough and it took us about ten minutes
to haul each net. After they were all in, we estimated
that we had caught about eight hundred codfish. This
was considered a very fine catch. Then a consultation
was held to decide where to re-set the nets. It was
very important to know the direction in which the fish
had gone on the banks, for these big shoals were constantly
moving as they spawned.</p>

<p>After they had decided where to go our sail was
hoisted, and we started for another part of the fishing
banks; in the mean time the nets were inspected and
put into good order. When we reached the spot, we
sounded twice and found the sea too deep. When we
found a depth of one hundred fathoms we set our nets,
after which we returned home.</p>

<p>On our return we went on board of one of the ships,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and our fish was bought by the captain at a little over
eight dollars a "big hundred,"&mdash;that is, 112 cod.</p>

<p>On the deck of this ship were already several boat-loads
of cod; the fish were cleaned, flattened, washed
and salted, and laid in the hold on the top of one
another.</p>

<p>The captain said to me: "When I am loaded I shall
sail for my farm, and then lay the fish on the rocks
to dry. I have a nice little home by the sea. I hope
my boys will one of these days be sailors as I am."
Then we shook hands with the captain and returned
to our cabin.</p>

<p>Before we went to bed we learned that the catch of
all the boats of the settlement that day had been over
six hundred thousand cod.</p>

<p>The following morning found me ready to start at
the appointed time for fishing with hook and line.
The departure of the boats took place in the same
manner as the day before. Our boat was not so large
as the netting boat; it was not decked over.</p>

<p>Captain Johansen steered. The men of our crew
were Mats, Pehr, Anders, Ole, Knut, and Roar.</p>

<p>Captain Johansen had fished in the Arctic regions for
forty-two consecutive years. His face had been permanently
reddened by the wind. Whenever he had
a chance he had his pipe in his mouth, and he told
me that his pipe was one of his best friends.</p>

<p>We had a fair wind at the start and in about one
hour the men came to their buoys. Then we lowered
the sail. The sea was covered with boats; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
were nearly fifteen hundred in sight, for they had
come to that part of the banks from several other fishing
settlements. These boats were manned by about
eleven thousand sailors; men enough to man a big
fleet of men-of-war.</p>

<p>Captain Johansen said: "We are going to have
hard work raising our lines, but if we catch many fish
the work will seem to be much lighter to us."</p>

<p>"That is so," I said, "Captain, for when I go hunting
and see no game I get tired; but if I see plenty
of game, then I can tramp all day without fatigue."</p>

<p>A large reel was placed on one side of the
boat to haul in the line. Before we began to haul
the lines the captain remarked: "We attach four
lines together; each line is one hundred fathoms long.
The hooks are generally from four to six feet apart
and there are about one hundred and twenty on each
line. We have to pull in over twenty-four hundred
fathoms or over twenty-six thousand feet of line, to
which are attached about five thousand hooks."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said to the captain, "it will be hard
work and will take quite a while, especially if many
fish are caught."</p>

<p>"I hope, nevertheless, we shall catch many," he
replied with a smile, "for most of us have a home to
keep and a wife and children to clothe and feed."</p>

<p>We began to haul in the lines on the reel. How
we watched! How deep our eyes tried to see into
the water! It was quite exciting. We were fortunate:
a big shoal of fish had been passing on that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
part of the banks, and on many a hook a cod was
hanging. After we got through, we pulled towards
another of our buoys, passing several that belonged to
other fishermen on the way.</p>

<p>Having pulled in about three hundred fathoms of
our next line, we found that the rest of the line had
drifted into a net and some of the hooks were caught
and entangled in it, and we had a hard job to free
the line.</p>

<p>Then we rowed to a third buoy belonging to us
and began hauling. Almost every other hook had
caught a fish. The faces of the fishermen were full
of happiness. They felt that on that day they would
have a great catch, when suddenly one of the men
shouted, "Our line is entangled; I wonder whether it
has fouled a net or another line." But as we pulled
in the line we raised another line with it not belonging
to us. We had a hard time to separate them, but
after nearly half an hour's work succeeded in doing so.
We had caught over two hundred cod on this line.</p>

<p>Our fourth line proved to be entangled in nets as
well as also in several lines belonging to different
owners. The untwisting was something awful, and
it was no joke to separate them. Fortunately we
could tell to whom the lines belonged, for each one is
marked from distance to distance with the number of
the boat and the letter of the district from which the
craft comes. The rest of the lines were so badly
tangled that we concluded to cut them. Then we
pulled the cut pieces with the fish on them into our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
boat, intending to give them to their owners&mdash;not
a difficult task, as the marks of ownership were on
the tackles&mdash;and if they belonged to another settlement
the fish would be sold and the money given
them.</p>

<p>Captain Johansen and the crew thought the cod
would remain two days more. Their advance guard
had passed, but a great deal of the shoal was going
northward; and there were miles of cod still to pass
over the bank upon which we fished.</p>

<p>The wind had been gradually rising. We had had
two days of good weather, and now the sea was covered
with white caps. The daughters of &AElig;gir and Ran were
all white-hooded. But as we sailed for home the wind
suddenly increased; squall after squall followed each
other. We had to reef the sail; the sea at times
washed over us, and the poor fishermen began to think
seriously of throwing our cargo of fish overboard, for
we were pretty deeply loaded, but it would have been
like throwing away money, and they had worked so
hard to get it.</p>

<p>A big black cloud overspread our heads and hail
fell thickly upon us, and it hurt us badly for the
hailstones were hard and very big. I tried to protect
my face, for my sou'wester only protected well
the back of my head. The hail was succeeded by
sleet, the rigging and mast were covered with ice; our
garments and sou'westers were stiff, and we looked
like big icy things. The captain, looking at me with
a smile,&mdash;for he saw I did not like this sort of weather,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
said: "This weather is the forerunner of spring in
these high latitudes; the sun is getting higher at its
meridian every day."</p>

<p>It was dark long before we reached port, but the
men knew every rock on the coast, and yonder was
the lighthouse guiding us on our way. Boat after
boat entered the harbor, and not one of them was lost.</p>

<p>The next day the gale was such that no boat was
permitted to put out to sea. In the evening there
was very little talking, and for a while no one said a
word; then Captain Johansen broke the silence and
said: "Paul, this Arctic Ocean is the home of gales;
these often bring sadness to many homes; some of
us here have lost friends and relatives at sea. Some
years ago a fishing fleet of eight hundred boats was
caught in one of these sudden gales. After the boats
had come safely into port the roll-call showed that
twenty boats with their crews were missing."</p>

<p>"How sad!" I exclaimed; and as Captain Johansen
was speaking I wondered how many people thought,
when they ate fish, of the hard life of the poor and
brave fishermen and of the gales they encounter.</p>

<p>The fishermen wanted to entertain me before we
retired for the night, and Captain Larsen said, "I will
tell you, Paul, about one of the great sea battles of
the Vikings."</p>

<p class="cap">AFTER we had clustered round Captain Larsen,
he gave three or four big puffs of his pipe
and began:</p>

<p>The battle of Svold took place in the year one
thousand. Olaf Tryggvasson, King of Norway, had
left Vindland in the Baltic and was on his way back
to Norway with his fleet. He was on his ship the
<i>Ormrinn Lange</i> (the "Long Serpent"). Svein, the
King of Denmark, Olaf King of Sweden, and Erik
Jarl of Norway, his enemies, lay in ambush for him
under the island of Svold with all their ships. The
three chiefs landed on the island. After a while they
espied some ships of the fleet of Olaf. Among them
was a particularly large and splendid one. Both kings
said: "This is an exceedingly fine ship; it must be
the <i>Long Serpent</i>."</p>

<p>Erik Jarl, who knew the <i>Long Serpent</i>, answered:
"This is not the <i>Long Serpent</i>, which is much larger
and grander, though this is a fine ship."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Ship after ship passed by and the two kings took
each of them to be the <i>Long Serpent</i>, but they received
invariably the same answer from Erik Jarl.</p>

<p>The three chiefs drew lots to know who should
first attack Olaf Tryggvasson's ship. Svein, King of
Denmark, drew the lot to attack first; then Olaf, King
of Sweden, and Erik Jarl last, if it should be found necessary.
It was agreed between the three chiefs that each
should own the ships which he himself cleared of men
and captured.</p>

<p>Erik Jarl's ship was called the <i>Jarn Bardi</i>, an iron-clad
ram which had the reputation of cleaving through
every ship it attacked; there were beaks on the top of
both stem and stern, and below these were thick iron
plates which covered the whole of the stem and stern
all the way down to the water.</p>

<p>When the chiefs had arranged their plan, they saw
three very large ships, and following them a fourth;
they all saw a dragon-head on the stem, ornamented so
that it seemed of pure gold, and it gleamed far and
wide over the sea as the sun shone on it. As they
looked at the ship, they wondered greatly at its length,
for the stern did not appear till long after they had
seen the prow, as the ship glided past the point of the
island slowly; then all knew that this was the <i>Long
Serpent</i>&mdash;a ship about three hundred and sixty feet
long, with a crew of over seven hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>At this sight many a man grew silent.</p>

<p>Sigvaldi Jarl, one of Olaf Tryggvasson's commanders,
let down the sails on his ship and rowed up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
towards the island. Thorkel Dydril on the <i>Tranan</i>
(the "Crane"), and the other ship-steerers (for the
commanders were so called), lowered their sails also
and followed him. All waited for Olaf Tryggvasson.
When King Olaf saw that his men had lowered their
sails and were waiting for him, he steered towards them
and asked them why they did not go on. They told
him that a host of foes was before them and that the
fleets of the allied kings lay around the point.</p>

<p>Advancing further the King Olaf Tryggvasson and
his men saw that the sea was covered far and wide with
the warships of his foes. Thorkel Dydril, a wise and
valiant man, said: "Lord, here is an overwhelming force
to fight against: let us hoist our sails and follow our
men out to sea. We can still do so while our foes prepare
themselves for battle, for it is not looked upon as
cowardice by any one for a man to use forethought for
himself and his men." King Olaf Tryggvasson's men
now missed the ships that had sailed ahead.</p>

<p>King Olaf replied loudly: "Tie together the ships
and let the men prepare for battle!" for in those days
it was the custom to tie the ships together. Then the
commanders arranged the host.</p>

<p>The <i>Long Serpent</i> was in the middle, with the <i>Short
Serpent</i> on one side and the <i>Crane</i> on the other, and
four other ships on each side of them; but this fleet
was but a small one compared with the overwhelming
fleet which their enemies had.</p>

<p>When Olaf saw that they began to tie together the
stern of the <i>Long Serpent</i> and of the <i>Short Serpent</i>, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
called out loudly, "Bring the <i>Long Serpent</i> forward; I
will not be the hindmost of all my men in this fleet
when the battle begins!"</p>

<p>Then Ulf ("Wolf") the Red, the king's standard
bearer, and who was also his prow-defender, said: "If
the <i>Long Serpent</i> shall be put as much forward as it
is larger and longer than other ships, the men in the
bows will have a hard time of it!"</p>

<p>The king cried: "I had the <i>Serpent</i> made longer
than other ships so that it should be put forward
more boldly in battle, but I did not know I had a
prow-defender who was faint-hearted!"</p>

<p>Ulf replied: "Turn thou, King, no more back in
defending the high deck than I will in defending
the prow!"</p>

<p>Olaf Tryggvasson stood aloft on the high deck of
the <i>Long Serpent</i>. He had a shield, and gilt helmet,
and was easily recognized. He wore a red silk kirtle
over his ring-armor.</p>

<p>When he saw that the ships of his foes began to
separate, and that the standards were raised in front of
each chief, he asked: "Who is the chief of that
standard which is opposite us?" He was told that
it was King Svein of Denmark with the Danish
ships.</p>

<p>"What chief follows the standard which is to the
right?" He was told that it was Olaf of Sweden.</p>

<p>"Who owns those large ships to the left of King
Olaf of Sweden?"</p>

<p>"It is Erik Jarl Hakonson," they replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Svein of Denmark, Olaf of Sweden, and Erik
Jarl rowed towards the <i>Long Serpent</i>.</p>

<p>The battle horns were blown and both sides shouted
a war-cry, and soon the combat raged fiercely,&mdash;at
first with arrows from crossbows and long bows, then
with spears and javelins and slings&mdash;and King Olaf
Tryggvasson fought most manfully. King Svein's
men turned the prows of many of their ships towards
both sides of the <i>Long Serpent</i>. The Danes also
attacked the <i>Short Serpent</i> and the <i>Crane</i>. The
carnage was great.</p>

<p>King Svein made the stoutest onset. King Olaf
Tryggvasson made the bravest defence with his men,
but they fell one after another. King Olaf fought
almost too boldly, shooting arrows and hurling spears;
he went forward in hand-to-hand fight, and cleft
many a man's skull with his sword.</p>

<p>The attack proved difficult for the Danes, for the
stern-defenders of the <i>Long Serpent</i> and of the <i>Short
Serpent</i> hooked anchors and grappling hooks to King
Svein's ships, and as they could strike down upon the
enemy with their weapons, for they had much larger
and higher boarded ships, they cleared of men all the
Danish ships which they had laid hold of. King
Svein had to retreat.</p>

<p>In the mean time Erik Jarl had come first with
the <i>Jarn Bardi</i> alongside the farthest ship of Olaf
Tryggvasson on one wing, cleared it, and cut it from the
fastenings; he then boarded the next one, and fought
until it was cleared of men; and as the men fell on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
ship, other Danes and Swedes took their places. At
last all of Olaf Tryggvasson's ships had been cleared of
men and captured except the <i>Long Serpent</i>, which
carried all the men who were now able to fight.</p>

<p>Erik Jarl then attacked the <i>Long Serpent</i> with five
large ships; he laid the <i>Jarn Bardi</i> alongside, and then
ensued the fiercest fight and the most terrible hand-to-hand
struggle of the day, and such a shower of weapons
was poured upon the <i>Long Serpent</i> that the men
could hardly protect themselves.</p>

<p>King Olaf Tryggvasson's men became so furious
that they jumped upon the gunwales in order to reach
their foes with their swords and kill them, and many
went straight overboard; for out of eagerness and
daring they forgot that they were not fighting on dry
ground, and sank down with their weapons between
the ships.</p>

<p>When only a few men were left on the <i>Long Serpent</i>
around the mast amidships, Erik Jarl boarded it
with fourteen men. Then came against him King Olaf's
brother-in-law, Hyrning, with his followers, and between
them ensued a hard fight. It was ended by
Erik Jarl's retreating onto the <i>Bardi</i>, which took
away the dead and the wounded, and in their stead
brought fresh and rested men.</p>

<p>When Erik had prepared his men, he said to Thorkel
the High, a wise and powerful chief: "Often have I
been in battles, and never have I before found men
equally brave and so skilled in fighting as those on the
<i>Long Serpent</i>, nor have I seen a ship so hard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
conquer. Now, as thou art one of the wisest of men,
give me the best advice thou knowest as to how the
<i>Long Serpent</i> may be won!"</p>

<p>Thorkel replied: "I cannot give thee sure advice,
but I can say what seems to me best to do. Thou
must take large timbers, and let them fall from thy
ship upon the gunwales of the <i>Long Serpent</i>, so that
it will careen; then thou wilt find it the easier to board
the ship."</p>

<p>Erik Jarl did as Thorkel had told him.</p>

<p>King Olaf and his men defended themselves with
the utmost bravery and manliness; they slew many of
their foes, both on the <i>Jarn Bardi</i> and on other ships
which lay near theirs.</p>

<p>When the defenders of the <i>Long Serpent</i> began to
thin out, Erik Jarl boarded it and met with a warm
reception.</p>

<p>Olaf Tryggvasson shot at him with spears. The
first flew past his right side, the second his left, and the
third struck the fore part of the ship above his head.</p>

<p>Then King Olaf said: "Never before did I thus
miss a man; great is the Jarl's luck."</p>

<p>In a short time most of King Olaf's champions fell,
though they were both strong and valiant. Among
them Hyrning, Thorgier, Vikar, and Ulf the Red,
and many other brave men who left a famous name
behind. The <i>Long Serpent</i> was now cleared of men
and captured, but Olaf Tryggvasson was never seen
or heard of more. He probably threw himself into
the sea not to survive his defeat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a grand fight, Captain Larsen!" I exclaimed,
as the narrator concluded his story. I
thanked the captain, and after this we all went to
our bunks to sleep.</p>

<p>The following day was Sunday. There was no
buying or selling of fish. Every man was shaved
and wore clean linen; the church was crowded with
fishermen, and the afternoon was spent in making
social visits.</p>

<p>I had fished with the four boats of our house, and
now I made my preparations for sailing northward.
Our catch of fish and that in several neighboring
fishing settlements during the fishing season had
amounted to over twenty-two millions of cod.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Sailing along the Coast of Finmarken.&mdash;Hammerfest, the
most Northern Town in the World.&mdash;Schools.&mdash;Fruholmen,
the most Northern Lighthouse in the World.&mdash;Among
the Sea Lapps.&mdash;Men and Women Sailors.</p></div>


<p class="cap">LEAVING the fishing settlement, the <i>Ragnild</i>,
which I had rejoined, sailed along the rugged
and dreary shore of Finmarken, the most northern part
of the continent of Europe, passing now and then a
solitary fisherman's house, or a settlement hidden from
sight, though the stranger would never dream that
any human being lived in this land of rocks and
desolation.</p>

<p>We next came to Hammerfest, in 70&deg; 40' north
latitude, the most northern town in the world. In its
commodious port were English, French, Russian, German,
Swedish, and Norwegian vessels. Hundreds of
fishing boats were there also, waiting for favorable
winds to continue their voyage. Steamers were going
and coming from the south.</p>

<p>The population was about three thousand souls.
There were warehouses owned by rich merchants, a
church, a comfortable hotel, good schools where boys
and girls can learn French, English, German, Latin
and Greek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The streets were filled with snow. But though so
far north there was not a particle of ice in the port, on
account of the warm Gulf Stream, though sometimes
the thermometer reaches 20 degrees below zero.
Often during the winter the mercury stands for consecutive
days above the freezing point.</p>

<p>After leaving Hammerfest we sailed towards North
Cape. Suddenly I heard one of the sailors on the
watch shout, "Light! Light!" "What," said I, "a
lighthouse so far north?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the captain, who was standing near
me; "it is the most northern light on the globe. It
is the light on the island of Fruholmen, situated in
latitude 71&deg; 5' north." We sailed as far as North
Cape, on the island of Mager&ouml;, rising majestically to a
height of nine hundred and eighty feet above the sea,
and in latitude 71&deg; 10'. At the top of the cape there
was evidently a gale, for the snow was flying to a great
height.</p>

<p>As we were sailing along the shore, I saw some
strange-looking weather-beaten logs, covered with
barnacles. The captain said to me, "Some of these
logs come probably from the coast of South America,
from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers; the Gulf Stream
has brought them here. It has taken them a long
time to reach this place, for they are covered with
barnacles."</p>

<p>Instead of doubling North Cape, we sailed through
the narrow Mager&ouml; Sound which separates the island
from the mainland.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/023.png" width="600" height="384" alt="" title="" />
"We sailed towards North Cape."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>We had hardly entered the sound when I was
astonished by the view that met my eyes, for now
there were fishing settlements coming suddenly into
view, with comfortable, white-painted houses, ships at
anchor, glittering churches shining in the sun, and
school buildings.</p>

<p>We sailed across the Porsanger Fjord. Far off was
Nordkyn, upon the summit of which I had stood.
The coast looked dreary indeed! We sailed across
Laxe Fjord and doubled Nordkyn.</p>

<p>The following day we entered a fjord and came
upon a number of fishing boats that were returning
from the open sea. Some of these boats rowed towards
us, and soon were alongside of our craft, and
we engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>These people appeared very strange; they were
dressed like the nomadic Lapps, with the noteworthy
exception, however, that the fur of the reindeer skin
was on the <i>inside</i> of their garments. They were Sea
Lapps.</p>

<p>I looked at the crews of the boats, and was more
astonished still, for some of the boats were partly
manned by women, and big girls; other crews were
entirely composed of women with a man for captain.
One boat was entirely manned by women, the captain
included. I could not easily distinguish the men
from the women, for the features of the women were
coarse from exposure to the storms of the Arctic Sea.
They wore reindeer trousers like the men, as indeed
do the women of the nomadic Lapps. They rowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
quite as well as the men, too. They were distinguishable
by their long shaggy hair. It was of a dark
chestnut, with a reddish tinge&mdash;almost black in some.
They wore it hanging over their shoulders. It was
indeed a strange sight, and I looked at them with
great curiosity, for I had never seen such people
before&mdash;women who were sailors, some captains of
boats, going to sea and braving the storms of the
inhospitable ocean.</p>

<p>Captain Petersen said to me: "Almost all these
sea Laplanders own their crafts. Some of these
are commanded by the husband, while the wife, the
daughters, sister or hired woman form the crew; the
women are very hardy, and excellent sailors; they
pull as hard as strong men, and can use the oar as
long as the men do."</p>

<p>The captain was right&mdash;for I could not see any
difference between their rowing and that of the men as
they followed us.</p>

<p>When they learned that I had come to see their
land and wanted to live among them, they were glad.
They asked my name, and they were told that I was
called Paulus.</p>

<p>Then many of these Sea Lapps said:</p>

<p>"Come, Paulus, and stay a few days with us; we
will take good care of you;" and pointing to a hamlet
at a distance, "there we live, and soon we shall be at
home."</p>

<p>Looking towards where they pointed, I saw smoke
curling up from strange-looking dwellings. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
settlement was scattered on the brow of a hill looking
down upon the fjord.</p>

<p>As the word went round that I was coming to stay
with them, the Sea Lapps made haste and rowed
with all their might; the women were especially in
earnest, for they wanted to prepare their houses for
my reception before I landed. Soon they all were
far ahead, and after they had landed I saw them running
as fast as they could towards their homes. Evidently
they were going to announce my arrival to the
people who had remained at home.</p>

<p>Here I parted with the <i>Ragnild</i>, which sailed to
another fjord for more fish.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>A Sea Lapp Hamlet.&mdash;Strange Houses.&mdash;Their Interiors.&mdash;Summer
Dress of the Sea Lapps.&mdash;Primitive Wooden Cart.&mdash;Animals
Eat Raw Fish.&mdash;I Sleep in a Sea Lapp's
House.&mdash;they Tell Me to Hurry Southward.</p></div>


<p class="cap">WHEN I had landed, and ascended the hill
towards the settlement, I found myself in a
Sea Lapp hamlet. I looked at their dwellings with
great curiosity. Some of the buildings were conical
and resembled the tent of the nomadic Lapps; but
they were built of sod or turf. There were others
resembling in shape log houses, with only a ground
floor, built entirely of the same material. Others were
partly of stone and turf. Some were entirely of stone
slabs. Two houses were built of logs.</p>

<p>In the mean time the people had changed their
clothes, and wore their summer every-day dress called
<i>vuolpo</i> (though it was still cold), ready to receive
me.</p>

<p>Some of these summer dresses were made of coarse
vadmal of a gray or blackish color; others were blue.
Most were in a ragged state, or patched&mdash;having when
new been used as Sunday clothes. The men wore
square caps of red or blue flannel, and the women had
extraordinary looking head-gear resembling casques of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dragoons, on account of the wooden frame under the
cloth. These were also red or blue.</p>

<p>"Come in," said one of the Sea Lapps, "come into
my <i>gamme</i> (house) and see how I live." His house
was of conical shape and built of sod, supported inside
by a rough frame formed of branches of trees. A fire
was burning in the centre of the hut, the smoke escaping
by an aperture above; and upon cross poles hung
shoes, boots, and clothing. This sod hut was about
twelve feet high and eight feet in diameter. A large
kettle hung over the fire. It was filled with seaweed,
which was cooking for the cows. I tasted it and
found it very palatable and not at all salt.</p>

<p>I was hardly in this <i>gamme</i> when I wished myself
out, but kept this to myself, for I did not want to
hurt the feelings of the poor Lapp. The interior of
the place was horribly filthy&mdash;dirty reindeer skins
lay on the ground upon old dirty dried grass. A tent
of a nomadic Lapp was a model of cleanliness compared
with this! The outside was just as bad; on the
ground lay the entrails and heads of fish, and a couple
of barrels filled with half-putrid liver which in time
would make a barrel of brown oil; there were a great
many codfish heads drying on the rocks.</p>

<p>"Will you stay and have a cup of coffee with us?"
my host asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," added his wife, "it will not take long to
make a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"Not to-day," I replied, "but some other time."</p>

<p>"All right," the host said; "don't forget."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>I was glad when I got out. This abode was the
<i>gamme</i> of a poor Sea Lapp, and the poorest kind of
dwelling seen among them.</p>

<p>The next house, which was at a short distance,
belonged to the captain of one of the boats which had
been alongside of our ship. He and his wife were
waiting for me outside and bade me come in. His
house was long, narrow, and low, and built entirely of
flat stones. I entered through a wooden door a
room built in the centre of the house. Their winter
garments hung on poles, there was a pile of firewood,
and a heap of dry seaweed and reindeer moss.</p>

<p>I followed him to the room on the left. There the
family lived. The floor of the room was covered with
flat slabs; in one corner was a bed on the floor, itself
made of young branches of birch, kept together by
logs. The skins that made the rest of the bed were
outside to be aired. This room was about ten feet
long and about ten feet wide, the whole width of the
house, and lighted by a small window with tiny panes
of glass.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed in the corner was a small
cow. Such a cow! I had never seen one so small.
In the opposite corner was another one. These two
cows were hardly three feet high, and between the two
were a calf and three sheep. "These animals," said
my host, "help us to keep our room warm and comfortable
during the winter months."</p>

<p>This was a very strange way of heating a room, I
thought to myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come and stay with us to-night," added the
Lapp. "You will sleep comfortably and you will not
be cold."</p>

<p>I accepted.</p>

<p>The furniture of the room consisted of some kettles,
a coffee pot, coffee grinder, a lamp, and a few chests.
Everything, strange to say, was very clean. The third
room contained a few nets, and on the floor were a few
reindeer skins upon which slept any stranger who
chanced to share their dwelling. I was a favored
guest. I was to sleep in the same room with the
host, hostess, cows and sheep. I was considered as
one of the family.</p>

<p>I slept splendidly. In the morning I had water to
wash my face with. That was fine! I gave myself
a good rubbing with soap, for I said, "Paul, after
you leave this place it will be quite a while before you
wash your face, except with snow." But I could not
as successfully get rid of the odor of the stable, which
clung to my clothes with a persistence that would
have driven every friend I had away from me if I had
been at home.</p>

<p>Not far from this <i>gamme</i> was the house of another
well-to-do Sea Lapp, one of the rich fellows of the
hamlet. His house was long and narrow, one part
built of logs, the remainder of layers of turf.</p>

<p>The wooden part was the every-day room&mdash;parlor,
bedroom, kitchen. The roof was supported by poles
and covered with birch bark, over which more than a
foot of earth had been placed to keep the cold out;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the birch bark was used as shingles and kept the rain
from dripping inside. Two little cows, two dwarfish
oxen, eight sheep, and two goats completed the household,
and these were housed in the turf compartment.</p>

<p>Further on I passed a somewhat long and narrow
house built entirely of turf, which I also visited, and
as I came out of it a very strange sight greeted me.
Several people were returning with their dwarfish carts
loaded with seaweed; each was drawn by a team of
two wretched little oxen not bigger than the cows of
the place&mdash;that is, not more than three feet in height.
Some were driven by women, others by men or
children.</p>

<p>These queer-looking small carts were of the same
pattern as those used thousands of years ago. The
wheels were of a solid block of wood hewn out of the
trunk of fir trees, which grow on the banks of some of
the fjords, though the land is so far north, owing to the
effects of the Gulf Stream. These wheels were of the
pattern first made by man, and for thousands of years
there had been no improvement; just as in some parts
of the world the natives to-day still use the dug-out,
or canoe made of the trunk or bark of a tree&mdash;the
primitive boat of man. The carts were loaded with
seaweed, fish, or reindeer moss.</p>

<p>I stayed here several days, and one day I went to
see Ole Maja, the nabob of the place. Ole was an
old Sea Lapp, who was considered very rich among
his neighbors. His house was entirely built of logs,
and was much admired by the people. The little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
room had two plain pine-wood beds, a cast-iron stove
(the only one in the hamlet), a clock and three wooden
chairs. Everything was exceedingly clean. He belonged
to the best type of Sea Lapps.</p>

<p>Ole owned a horse, which had a special stable
built of turf, and his four cows, two oxen, and twelve
sheep were kept in another building. I asked what
he wanted a horse for in these high latitudes. He
answered: "We use them on the frozen rivers to
draw logs." "The hay I gather in summer," he
added, "is for him. Horses are very particular, they
will not eat the kind of food we give to our cattle,
sheep or goats." I did not wonder at this.</p>

<p>I noticed, as there was no snow on the ground, that
all the dwellings of the little hamlet had small patches
of land round them, which were to be planted with
potatoes when warm weather came.</p>

<p>Those who had the best houses wanted me to stay
with them, and to avoid making distinctions I agreed
to remain with each family one day until I went away.
They seemed very much pleased.</p>

<p>I witnessed one day the feeding of the cattle, sheep,
and goats. This was a sight! They were to be fed
on that day with raw fish cut in pieces, instead of
boiled heads of dry cod, or boiled lichen. These pieces
of fish were put in large wide wooden pails, the animals
were called, and they devoured the contents with
great avidity. This amazed me greatly. Just think
of cattle feeding on raw fish!</p>

<p>One day found me comfortably settled in a <i>gamme</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which belonged to Matias Laiti. The chief meal was
of reindeer meat and fish,&mdash;a boiled head of fresh
cod. This is considered the sweetest and nicest part of
the fish. A great wooden bowl of milk was given to me.
The milk had a queer taste&mdash;it had a fishy taste&mdash;so
had everything else, I thought. I am sure that if the
cannibals that were my friends in Africa had been here,
and eaten me up, they would have found that I tasted
of fish, for I had been living on fish ever so long.</p>

<p>I kept visiting one Sea Lapp and his family after
another, and had a good time&mdash;living on fish and
reindeer meat, for the Sea Lapps own reindeer which
are kept for their relations or friends further in the
interior. Sea Lapps intermarry much with river
Lapps, and also with nomadic Lapps. They form
really one family.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning they were dressed in their
best <i>vuolpo</i> head-dresses and garments. These were
red, blue and white, with red and yellow bands at the
bottom of the skirt. Some had pretty belts, and wore
necklaces of large glass beads. The women and men
had combed their hair, and it was not to be combed
again for a week. They all had washed their faces
and hands. One woman wore a pair of blue woollen
trousers, fitting tight from the knees to the ankle,
had put on a new pair of Lapp shoes, and wore casque-like
head-gear, which was blue like her dress and had
red seams. The boats were ready to be rowed across
the fjord to take them to the church, where service was
held once in three weeks. They were all Lutherans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>There were hardly any children in the place. The
school was the other side of the fjord by the church.
The children were about to return to their parents,
for in summer there is no school. All the Swedish-Norwegian
Lapps know how to read and write.</p>

<p>One evening as we were talking round a bright fire,
one of the Lapps said to me, "Paulus, you have told
us that you intend to travel southward by land. If
that is so, there is no time to be lost, for the sun is
getting more powerful every day, and the snow will
soon be in an unfit condition for reindeer to travel on,
and the ice over the rivers and lakes will break; besides
you are going to have great difficulty in procuring
reindeer, for no reindeer can be had at the post
stations now. You may be detained on the way, and
be obliged to wait until snow has melted and the
rivers become navigable. At this time of the year the
reindeer are very feeble; it is the worst time to travel
with them; they shed their coats and horns and are
weak and lean from their winter digging. During the
day they feel the heat of the sun, and do not go as fast
as during the winter months. So, though we love to
have you stay with us, if you want to go you had
better hasten your departure. Do not forget to take
with you blue or green goggles, for the glare is so intense,
on account of the bright sun, you will surely
become snow-blind if you have none with you. We
are going to send for reindeer, and we will give you
a guide to go with you."</p>

<p>The long days come on with remarkable rapidity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in this far North. The sun was below the horizon
till the latter part of January, and now on the 25th of
April in clear weather I could read a newspaper at
midnight. There were to be no more nights. The
Long Night had been driven away from the pole.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Comparison of Finmarken with Alaska.&mdash;The Two Lands
Much Alike.&mdash;What Must be Done for Alaska.&mdash;Colonization.&mdash;Importation
of Reindeer.&mdash;Protection of Fisheries.&mdash;Houses
of Refuge.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THAT same evening (it has to be called so for
the sake of distinction) I stood out on the
brow of the hill, looking at the fjord and Arctic
Ocean. Suddenly Alaska came to my mind. I remembered
all I had seen on the coast of Finmarken,
and also all I had encountered and done in "Snow
Land", "The Land of the Long Night," and "The
Land of the Winds," and I said to myself, "Why
should not Alaska have its fishing towns, settlements,
and hamlets, like those of Finmarken, and become as
prosperous as the country I have travelled through?"
There is a wonderful similarity between these two
countries; they are both exactly in the same latitudes;
they have the same kind of barren coast bathed by a
warm stream, and both have fjords.</p>

<p>Alaska has immense shoals of codfish and herring,
besides salmon. Both have their long nights, and
then long days of Midnight Sun. We must give inducements
to the people of Finmarken to come to
Alaska. They will find in their new country something
similar to the one they have left, they will enjoy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
same life. California and Oregon will provide the
people with flour and send them delicacies and
products of their state, and take in return the cod and
herring. The southern American countries would be
a great market for their codfish.</p>

<p>Then I thought that the only way to make Alaska
prosperous eventually, is to do exactly what the
Swedes and Norwegians have done for their country
in the far North. The fisheries must be protected,
and the laws regulating them must be enforced.
Then, as on the Finmarken coast, towns, hamlets,
and fishing settlements will rise in the course of time,
and the wealth of the people will come from the
fish&mdash;their gold from the sea. Then we shall have
more American-born sailors to man our ships.</p>

<p>Some of the barren hills of Alaska should be planted
with juniper, birch, alder, and with pine and fir and
other trees growing in the high altitudes of the mountains
of Scandinavia. It will take a good deal of time,
but the world was not made in one day. The Scandinavian
laws regarding the cutting of trees below a
certain size ought to be adopted for Alaska.</p>

<p>Then we must import many reindeer, and establish
the same laws in regard to them and their pasture as
the Swedes and Norwegians have done. A great
many of these reindeer must be broken, and brought up
to eat kept reindeer moss. Samoides and Laplanders
must be induced to come to Alaska; they know how
to take care of the reindeer, they are accustomed to
law and order, and they are absolutely honest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, they are honest," I said loudly without
knowing it; "for they knew I had money with
me, and I have never been afraid of being robbed or
murdered. Such thoughts have never entered my
head." Then I thought of the good care these kind
people took of me when there was danger in travelling.</p>

<p>Wherever there is a little good grazing land, houses
and farms of refuge, and post stations where reindeer
can be procured, must be built by the government in
the interior, so that people can find refuge from the
terrific storms that blow over Alaska, and I cannot
realize how they could be fiercer than those I had
encountered in Finmarken. With reindeer and skees,
travelling will become easy, and good distances will be
made in a short time.</p>

<p>In summer boat stations must be established along
navigable rivers, also a tariff made for distances and
for food&mdash;so that there be no overcharge&mdash;as
is done in Sweden, Norway, and Finland.</p>

<p>Little hamlets with the church and the school will
rise. Doctors must be sent, and paid a salary by the
government; besides a fee must be given by the
patient, who will then not call the doctor for a trifle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>Preparations to Leave the Arctic Coast.&mdash;Great Danger of
Encountering Melting Snow, or Rivers Made Dangerous
by the Ice Breaking.&mdash;Reindeer Come.&mdash;Farewell to
the Sea Lapps.&mdash;I Leave for more Southern Land.</p></div>


<p class="cap">THE advice the Sea Lapps had given me was not
to be neglected, and I at once made hasty
preparations for my journey southward. There was
not one hour or one minute to be lost. I did not
want to be caught in the midst of vast tracts of half-melted
snow, seven, eight, or ten feet deep, with
reindeer unable to travel further; or to drive over
rivers and lakes covered with treacherous ice, made the
more dangerous by being hidden under the snow&mdash;or,
worst of all, to find no reindeer to carry me
onward; or delayed somewhere, waiting for the snow
to melt and the land to become dry and the rivers
navigable, for during the time of thaw the country
is full of bogs and swamps, and the rivers become
in many places but roaring torrents, their waters
dashing against huge boulders strewn in their beds, or
breaking over them in rapids and pouring cataracts.</p>

<p>My little sleigh, my skees, my bags, and winter outfits
were landed, and were before me. I left off my
sou'wester and oilskin garments and sea-boots, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
I said to them: "We have had rough weather together
on this stormy Arctic sea. Henceforth I do not need
you any more; I hope you will keep the Sea Lapp to
whom I give you as dry as you did me."</p>

<p>Then I donned my Lapp costume once more. Now
the fur shoes of winter were unsuitable to travel with,
for being porous they are only good to get over dry
and crisp snow with. I had to wear henceforth the
shoes or boots that are without fur and the leather of
which is prepared in such a manner as to be impermeable
to water or damp snow. I had provided myself
with two pairs of these, while at Haparanda on my way
to "The Land of the Long Night," for my return
journey,&mdash;a short pair, of the shape of the winter
shoes, and a pair of boots coming as high as my
knees.</p>

<p>One of the Lapps smeared them with a preparation
of tar and fat that he used for his own shoes. When
they were ready he said: "Now you are all right, no
dampness or water will penetrate them," and he gave
me some of the stuff to use on my journey, saying,
"Rub your shoes every two days with it." I thanked
him. Then I put on a new pair of woollen socks. I
surrounded my feet with the Lapp grass, and wore my
short boots.</p>

<p>While turning over in my mind the mishaps that
might come to me on this southward journey, I
fancied the same friendly voices I had heard before
from across the Atlantic called to me: "Hurry on,
Friend Paul! Hurry on! for there is danger in delay;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and when your journey is finished come back to us at
once."</p>

<p>"I will hurry on," I replied aloud. "Do not be
afraid. I will return at once to our dear United States."
After this I was more impatient to leave than before.
I waited anxiously for the reindeer to arrive.</p>

<p>Henceforth I shall wear only one fur garment,
instead of two as I did during my journey northward,
for the weather is getting warmer every day. After I
was dressed completely I looked affectionately at my
little sleigh, for I remembered the many hundreds of
miles we had travelled together, what fun I had had,
and how hard it was at first to learn to drive reindeer
and to keep inside the sleigh, and all the sudden
upsettings I had.</p>

<p>Then I looked at my skees, and said: "Dear skees,
we are again to tramp over the snow together. I
wish I could leap over chasms with you, as the Lapps
do. I cannot do that; but we will walk on the snow,
and go down hill riding a stick. This will be great fun
for me anyhow."</p>

<p>Then I turned to the bags, and I said: "Dear bags,
I have often thought of you and how comfortable I
was with you." I remembered how cosy I was when
I slept in them on the snow. I did not mind how
hard the wind blew; the harder it blew the more comfortable
I felt inside of them. Near by them was the
big brown bearskin, which was safely fastened over
me in the sleigh. I said: "Dear bearskin, I think
a great deal of you also, for you have been my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
friend and have kept my legs so warm when I was
driving."</p>

<p>The next morning to my great joy the reindeer
came,&mdash;one for me, one for my guide, and a spare
one; but how differently they looked compared with
those I had in the winter. They were thin, and were
changing their coats. I did not wonder that the poor
reindeer did not look frisky&mdash;they had had to work
so hard for their living, digging the snow to reach the
moss during the whole of the winter.</p>

<p>I looked at the guide the kind Sea Lapps had provided
for me. He was the man who had come with
the reindeer. His name was Mikel. He was a
nomadic Lapp, but had come to visit his sister, who
had married a Sea Lapp. He was about four feet
eight inches in height, well built, broad shouldered,
nimble as a deer, about forty years old, with a face
made by the wind as red as a ripe tomato. He lived
and pastured his herd of reindeer south of Karesuando.</p>

<p>As we were introduced to each other we shook
hands, and I said, "Mikel, we are going to be
friends."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "we are to be friends."</p>

<p>Then all the Sea Lapps that were round us shouted
with one voice: "Paulus, we are all your friends!
Mikel will take good care of you."</p>

<p>"I will," said Mikel. "I will take good care of
Paulus." "Thank you, Mikel," I replied. From
that moment Mikel and I became fast friends.</p>

<p>An hour after the arrival of the reindeer and after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
hearty meal of codfish and black bread we were ready
to start.</p>

<p>Before seating myself in the sleigh, I turned my
face towards the North Pole and looked at the Arctic
Ocean beyond the fjord, and shouted: "Farewell to
thee! farewell, tempestuous Arctic Sea! farewell to
thy gales! farewell to thy snow and sleet storms.
But I am glad I have been through it all, for I
have learned something I did not know before. I have
gained knowledge about the people and 'The Land of
the Long Night.'"</p>

<p>One of the Sea Lapps held my reindeer, and after I
was seated another drew my bearskin round me, and
made it secure with the cord belonging to my sleigh.</p>

<p>When Mikel saw that I was ready he jumped into
his sleigh and we started.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye, Paulus!" shouted all the
Lapps.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye, dear Sea Lapps!"&mdash;I shouted
back to them, and the last words I heard were:
"Lucky journey, Paulus, come to see us again, come
to see us again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<div class="head4"><p>We Enter a Birch Forest.&mdash;The Reindeer are Soon Fagged.&mdash;Sleep
on the Snow.&mdash;The Rays of the Sun Melt
through the Snow.&mdash;Great Difficulty in Travelling.&mdash;Meet
Herds of Reindeer.&mdash;Reindeer Bulls Fight Each
Other.</p></div>


<p class="cap">WE entered the birch forest soon after our departure.
We had great difficulty in driving
among the trees. I was glad our reindeer were not as
frisky as in the earlier part of the winter. I could
hardly follow the track of Mikel, and sometimes I
could not do so at all. I drove sometimes against
one tree and then against another, then the boughs of
the birch would strike against my face. I had not
been five minutes among the birches when I was
upset.</p>

<p>At last, losing patience, I shouted to Mikel,
"When are we to get out of these birch trees into the
open country?" He replied: "We shall reach the
river soon."</p>

<p>The snow was not more than three or four or five
inches deep at first, but grew gradually deeper as we
moved further south. Along the coast of Finmarken
the heat of the Gulf Stream prevents it from lying
deep on the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon we reached the Tana river, at a
place called Polmak, and sped on over its snow-covered
ice.</p>

<p>Seven or eight miles was all that our reindeer could
do in an hour, and during the day we had to stop
several times to give them rest.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock we stopped for the night.
We spread our bags upon the snow, but we got into
one only, for two would have been too warm at this
time of the year; and as Mikel and I were ready to
disappear in them, I said "Good-night, Mikel," and
he replied "Good-night, Paulus."</p>

<p>It snowed during the night, and when we awoke in
the morning our bags were covered with it. I did
not wonder when I saw this that I had felt so warm
during the night.</p>

<p>I was the first to be up. I shook Mikel's bag and
shouted to him, "Get up, Mikel," and as his head
peeped out of his bag, I said "Good-morning," and
he cried "Good-morning, Paulus." Then we took
our breakfast. The reindeer, while we were asleep,
had dug through the snow to the lichen and fed, and
now were quietly resting.</p>

<p>We were soon on the way. As the sun rose higher
and higher and its rays grew more powerful, the
snow became soft, and the travelling so hard for our
reindeer that we had to stop; the thermometer marked
44 degrees in the shade and 80 degrees in the sun.
There were sometimes twenty or thirty degrees' difference
of temperature during the twenty-four hours, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the change came so slowly, hour after hour, that I did
not notice it.</p>

<p>So we had to stop travelling, and while the reindeer
rested we took to our skees and went in search of
game, but no foxes or wolves were to be seen. Towards
four o'clock in the afternoon the snow began to
freeze again, and we again took up our journey. Now
the nights have to be turned into days, for we can only
travel during the time when the sun is not shining or
has not great power.</p>

<p>We travelled without interruption the following
day, as the sky was cloudy and the snow was hard.
Towards midnight Mikel said: "Our reindeer are
tired, we must rest; but we will not sleep more than
three or four hours, for we must reach a station where
we can procure fresh reindeer."</p>

<p>We unharnessed our reindeer, and tied them with
long ropes. When this was done we got into our
bags and soon were fast asleep.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock Mikel awoke me, saying,
"Paulus, it is about time to go."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mikel," I replied, "let me sleep one hour
more, for I need more sleep. I want another snooze."</p>

<p>"There is no time to be lost," he replied; "you will
have a snooze later in the day."</p>

<p>So I rubbed my eyes to get fully awake, and washed
my face with snow, and felt ready for another start.</p>

<p>That morning the sky was very clear, and after a
while the sun shone brightly and the glare on the snow
was so great that it would have been impossible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
travel without green or blue goggles. I had two pairs
with me, in case I should lose or break one by some
accident.</p>

<p>On account of the strength of the sun's rays, which
melted the snow, we had to stop our travelling by
eleven o'clock. Our reindeer were exhausted.</p>

<p>I took my short pair of skees, covered with sealskin,
and went ptarmigan hunting. I killed four.
The birds had already dropped many of their white
feathers, which had been replaced by gray ones.
They were getting their summer coats, and would soon
be entirely gray.</p>

<p>After killing these I went further, and saw something
in the distance moving on the snow. Soon I
discovered it was a fox of a peculiar color which I had
not seen before. I lay flat on the snow, as the animal
was coming in my direction. He was evidently
hungry, and was hunting ptarmigans himself. When
he came within shooting distance I fired and killed
him. He was a white fox, but much of his snowy-white
fur had dropped, and was replaced by bluish.
I wondered if the change took place for his own
protection and advantage. When white he could not
be seen so easily by the creatures upon which he
preyed, and when bluish he could not be so easily
seen as if he had remained white.</p>

<p>When I returned Mikel was stretched on his back
on the snow with his arms spread out, and was snoring
like a good fellow. Oh, what a noise he made! He
had succeeded in frightening our reindeer, which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
moved away as far as the rope would allow them. I
did not wonder that they did not like Mikel's snoring.</p>

<p>After looking at Mikel I stretched myself on the
snow, but quite a distance from him, not to be disturbed
by his snoring. Now we did not require any
masks on our faces, and during the day slept without
being obliged to get into our bags.</p>

<p>Soon I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was attacked
by a big pack of wolves&mdash;I jumped up and looked
round, but there were no wolves. I had had the
nightmare from sleeping on my back. Mikel was
still snoring, and I looked at him and thought I would
let him snore a little more.</p>

<p>Towards four o'clock in the afternoon, as it was
beginning to freeze again and the snow was fit for
travelling, I awoke him. Soon after we started, and
we had not driven an hour when we saw a tent in the
distance and made for it. The Lapp family who
owned it received us with great hospitality. Coffee
was made and we were invited to spend the night. I
looked forward with great pleasure to the prospect of
a good warm meal of reindeer meat and good reindeer
broth.</p>

<p>These people were great friends of Mikel, and they
agreed to give us some of their reindeer that were not
as fagged out as ours. I was delighted.</p>

<p>How I enjoyed the warm reindeer meat and the
reindeer broth! It was fine! I was so hungry. After
this meal we were presented with a lot of cooked reindeer
meat for our journey, and one of the Lapps was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to go with us, for he wanted to see some of his friends
further south.</p>

<p>Towards three o'clock in the morning we started.
We saw many herds of reindeer&mdash;they were moving
westward towards the mountains that stretched to the
Arctic Sea. It was a grand sight. I saw more than
thirty thousand reindeer that day, in herds from one
thousand to two or three thousand. The Lapps on
their skees, with their dogs, urged the animals onward,
and the dogs brought those which were trying to go
astray, or lagged behind, into the ranks.</p>

<p>Many of the reindeer had already dropped their
horns, and the calving season had begun. How
pretty were the tiny baby reindeer; they were put on
special sleighs and driven in them, their mothers
following, uttering a queer kind of grunt.</p>

<p>The baggage of the family and tents went with
them, led by women who carried their young children
in their cradles slung on their backs.</p>

<p>Late that day I saw a splendid sight, two herds were
approaching each other in opposite directions. The
bulls of each herd advanced to charge the others with
great fury and began a terrible fight, advancing and retreating,
then charging again, butting furiously. The
horns of two combatants sometimes became entangled,
and it took a long time for them to disengage themselves.
Mikel said: "Sometimes they cannot be
separated and have to be killed." In the mean time,
the Lapps and dogs went after them, and with great
trouble they were parted and made to go to their respective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
herds. I noticed, as I went further south,
that the twilight was not so bright as it was in the
North&mdash;for in that northern land, the daylight comes
from the direction of the pole.</p>

<p>The darkest part of the day or night was somewhat
after eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, but even then I could read,
and as we travelled only Jupiter and Venus looked at
us&mdash;no other stars were visible, and towards half-past
one these two disappeared, for daylight was so strong;
and when the weather was clear after that time only
the pale blue sky of the North and its fleecy white
clouds were to be seen above our heads. How beautiful
it was!</p>

Ice Begins to Break.&mdash;Pass the Arctic Circle.</p></div>


<p class="cap">ONWARD we went, sleeping one day in the tent
of a nomadic Lapp, another day in our bags,
at other times in the <i>gamme</i> of a river Lapp. The
weather was very changeable; one day it was clear, the
next day the sky was gray. Snowy days were not
uncommon.</p>

<p>Midway between Nordkyn and Haparanda the
snow was of great depth. Only the tops of the birch
trees could be seen, and strange to say the branches
were in bloom, for the trees felt the heat of the sun,
and the snow had prevented the freezing of the ground
to a great depth. The snow must have been eight or
ten feet deep in some regions.</p>

<p>When we reached the summit of the plateau, the
watershed that divided the rivers falling into the Arctic
Sea and the Baltic, the weather was very stormy.
Though it was the 13th of May, we met a furious
snowstorm. This was dangerous for us, and Mikel
attached my sleigh to his by a long rope, so that we
might not become separated. The snowstorm seemed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
however, to give new strength to the reindeer, and
they went faster than usual, and besides the cold
weather we had had the two previous days&mdash;the
thermometer marking 15 to 18 degrees of frost&mdash;had
evidently invigorated them. For a while there
was a lull in the storm, and we were glad when we
came to a house of refuge.</p>

<p>The house was small and uninhabited, but clean
inside. Some food was hanging from the ceiling, belonging
to some Lapp or some wanderer like ourselves,
who had left it to have it on his return
journey. The food was sacred and safe. No one
would have dared to touch it, no matter how hungry
he was, for it did not belong to him, and the one who
had left it perhaps depended upon it to sustain his
life on his return. We peeped into the parcel&mdash;there
was some hard bread, reindeer cheese, and a smoked
reindeer tongue, a coffee kettle and some coffee, and a
few small pieces of wood tied together, to make a fire
to cook the coffee with. This was one of those houses
of refuge used only for shelter, without people to keep
them, built especially by the government for that purpose,
in case of sudden storm.</p>

<p>After a while I went out for a walk on my skees, to
stretch my legs, for I had been more than ten hours
seated in my sleigh. I took my gun with me. Soon I
spied some hares, and succeeded in killing two. These
were also changing their fur coats; much of their fur
was gray, and mixed with white; the hares were to be
gray during the summer months. As white was their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
protection in winter against big white owls, foxes, and
other animals, so their gray color would protect them
against their enemies in summer.</p>

<p>"Strange indeed is nature," I said to myself. "In
some cases the animals change their fur so that they
can approach their prey without being seen; in other
cases nature changes their fur to protect them against
their enemies."</p>

<p>When I returned I saw that Mikel had prepared
our supper. He had fetched some firewood he had
in his sleigh, and a bright fire was burning under our
coffee kettle. Reindeer meat, tongue, and reindeer
cheese had been put on a wooden dish, and two tin
cups were ready for the coffee to be poured into them.
We seated ourselves cross-legged on the floor, and
began our meal. What a nice cup of coffee we had!
How deliciously it tasted! How good was our coarse
hard black bread and our reindeer cheese, and smoked
reindeer tongue!</p>

<p>After we had drunk our coffee and eaten our supper
I noticed that Mikel was very silent and thoughtful.
I wondered if he was thinking of dangers ahead&mdash;of
the sudden stopping of our journey,&mdash;and just as I was
on the point of asking him why he was so thoughtful
he broke the silence himself and said: "Paulus, I
know where there is a big brown bear&mdash;a real big
fellow. The Bear's Night is not over with him yet,
and he must be still sleeping under the snow at the
place where I saw him last autumn getting ready to
go into his winter quarters."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't say so, Mikel!" I exclaimed. "Is
the bear sleeping near where we are?"</p>

<p>"Not so very near," he replied with a twinkle
in his eye. "A few hours will bring us to his
place."</p>

<p>He saw by my looks that I was ready to go after
the bear. It was just what he wished. So he continued:
"Paulus, shall we go and kill the bear, before
he awakes and goes into the mountains and forests to
commit his depredations,&mdash;for after his long fast he will
be very hungry&mdash;and are you willing to lose two or
three days and run the risk of having our journey
come to an end?"</p>

<p>When I heard this, I forgot all about the ice cracking
over the streams and lakes, about the snow melting
and preventing people from travelling. "Yes,
Mikel," I replied, "let us go after the bear. Afterwards
we will travel as fast as we can and take very
little sleep; perhaps we shall have luck and the weather
may be colder than usual for a while."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Mikel; "we will go after the
bear."</p>

<p>"Mikel," said I "before we stretch ourselves on
the floor and go to sleep, tell me how you know that
the bear is at the spot you suppose and that he is
spending his winter night there."</p>

<p>Mikel took a big pinch of snuff and replied:
"Paulus, I think I am the only one, that knows
where this bear is sleeping, for I have kept it a secret.
I hope no other person knows where he is, for I want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his skin. Besides I shall get a premium in money if
we kill him."</p>

<p>Then he added: "One day last fall as I was hunting
for ptarmigans I saw in the distance a huge brown
bear walking about and getting ready for his winter
quarters. I knew that he was seeking his winter lodgings,
because he was going round and round a big
cluster of pines before entering it. I watched! After a
a while he disappeared among the pines and I saw
no more of him. I knew that if he were not disturbed
or frightened away he would stay there. The bear
assuredly had seen the place during the summer and
thought it was a good one for his long sleep. This
bear knew that a big snowstorm was coming, and he
was not mistaken, for that night snow fell very heavily
and the storm lasted two days.</p>

<p>"The Bear's Night will soon be over in this
region," Mikel continued, "and at any moment this
bear may awaken, break through the snow that is
over him, and go away. Perhaps he is already gone.
At this time of the year the slightest noise will arouse
a bear, for by this time he has ceased to sleep
soundly."</p>

<p>Then he added: "We have had very little sleep
since we left the coast, Paulus; we need a good rest
before we go after the bear."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "my eyes ache for want of a good
long sleep."</p>

<p>We stretched ourselves on the earth floor, and soon
after I heard the snoring of Mikel. He was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
inveterate snorer,&mdash;I thought the champion snorer of
all those I ever had met.</p>

<p>I could not go to sleep, though I was so tired. I
turned first on one side, then on the other, then lay on
my back. I was much excited, for I thought of the
big brown bear and of the hunt that was before us.
At last I fell asleep. Suddenly I was awakened by a
shaking of Mikel, and as I opened my eyes he said,
"Paulus, what is the matter? You have been
shouting."</p>

<p>I was in a profuse perspiration. I had again had
nightmare from lying on my back. I was fighting
with a big bear which had seized me, and we were
wrestling and I was getting the worst of it, and when
ready to fall down in his grasp I had given a big
scream.</p>

<p>After our breakfast that morning, Mikel said: "We
must go and tell some of the folks who live in a little
hamlet not far from here to come with us."</p>

<p>"What do you call not far from here?" I asked.</p>

<p>I had begun to know what "not far" meant with
the Lapps. "Two hours' travel, or about fifteen
miles," he replied. "I have friends there."</p>

<p>Before leaving the little house of refuge Mikel
swept the floor, and made it as clean as we had found
it&mdash;for it is the custom of the people to do this
before they leave.</p>

<p>We then started eastward, and after two hours' travelling
we came to a few farms and entered a house.
Mikel told the people about the bear. The news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
soon spread and there was much excitement. During
the day preparations were made for the hunt.</p>

<p>The next morning men gathered, taking their guns
and big long sticks, with pikes at the ends to prod
the bear with; and all the dogs of the place followed
us. Many men started on their skees, others in their
sleighs. According to Mikel the bear was about
thirty miles away.</p>

<p>I was full of enthusiasm, and longed to come face
to face with the big brown bear of northern Europe.</p>

<p>About three hours after, we stopped. All the
people took counsel together and spoke in low voices.
Then Mikel, pointing out to me a big cluster of trees,
said, "Paulus, the bear is there."</p>

<p>Slowly we made for the spot, and then entered the
grove, and went in different directions seeking for
the bear's winter quarters. Soon after we saw a heap
of snow, or little hillock, that covered evidently some
boulders piled on the top of each other or a cluster
of fallen broken pine trees.</p>

<p>We looked at each other and pointed towards the
spot&mdash;we knew that the bear was under the snow
there. Mikel whispered to me, "The bear sleeps
under that hillock of snow."</p>

<p>We surrounded the place, then on a sudden we
shouted and made a terrific noise. Two or three
of the men fired their guns, the dogs barked furiously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/024.png" width="600" height="380" alt="" title="" />
"He sat on his haunches and looked at us, uttering a tremendous growl."</div>

<p>Then we saw the centre of the heap or hillock of
snow tremble, as if some live creature were moving
slowly under it. Then the snow moved a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
quicker. There was no mistake, the bear was awakened,
had moved, and was on the point of rising; he
was listening, and getting ready to come out. The
noise had frightened him. The snow trembled more
and more and rose higher and higher. Suddenly
there was a great upheaval, and great cracks appeared
in the crusted snow. Then we saw peeping out the
head and back of a huge brown bear, then two legs,
and finally the whole animal.</p>

<p>He looked round him with amazement. He seemed
to be dazed at the strange and sudden sight before
him. He sat on his haunches and looked at us,
uttering a tremendous growl. We could not tell
whether he meant to fight or to run. The dogs barked
angrily around the huge beast, but did not dare to
approach near enough to attack him. In the meantime
we had all drawn together so that we could fire
without danger of hitting any of our party. The
bear was getting ugly, gave a series of fierce growls,
and rose on his hind legs. At this moment Mikel
and I fired. A grunt of pain showed that the animal
was hit. He ran a few steps towards us and as we got
ready to fire again the big beast fell, his blood reddening
the snow.</p>

<p>We gathered round and looked at him. He was a
huge beast, but very thin from his long fast, for he
had been six months or more without food.</p>

<p>After the killing of the bear there was no time to
be lost, for we had deviated from our course and had
gone eastward into Finland. So now we had to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
westward, and after two days' travelling we came to
the river Muonio, to a Finnish hamlet called Kuttainen,
not far from Karesuando.</p>

<p>Now travelling became really dangerous. The
frozen river was full of treacherous cracks, and
others were appearing all the time. Once in a while
we came to small open spaces, where we could see the
swift water of the stream rushing with great rapidity;
this made me shudder. In some places there were
large pools of water.</p>

<p>It was getting really warm. Some days my "pesh"
was comfortable, at other times it was much too warm,
the thermometer reaching 48 to 50 degrees in the
shade and 86 to 88 degrees in the sun. The dripping
from the melted snow came into the river from
the hills, and had succeeded in many places in melting
the ice on the banks. This travelling was no joke.
I followed Mikel, and watched him constantly, fearing
that his reindeer and sleigh would disappear under
the ice. Travelling appeared to become more and
more perilous as we followed the Muonio southward.
At times I could hear the angry water under the ice
striking against boulders, and this became quite
common.</p>

<p>At last I shouted to Mikel, "Let us travel on the
land, for surely if we do not we shall fall through the
ice and be engulfed."</p>

<p>"We cannot," he shouted back, "the snow is too
soft. Our reindeer could not pull our sleighs. We
can get along much better on the river, though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ice is very bad. Trust in me, Paulus. I have made
this journey over the Muonio River many times before,
but you must follow me very closely, for sometimes
I shall have to pass near rotten ice or open
spots."</p>

<p>"I will follow you carefully, dear Mikel. Go on!
Go on!" I said.</p>

<p>So I followed Mikel closely, as he had bade me,
but what thumps our sleighs would sometimes get on
the now uneven ice of the river! Fortunately they
were very strongly built.</p>

<p>We slept at a place called Songamuodka. In the
morning it snowed, but the flakes were big and soft
and melted as they fell on the old snow. I met no
more herds of reindeer, but since I had left on my
journey southward I had seen between sixty-five and
seventy thousand of them.</p>

<p>Two days after I saw the church spire of Pajala,
rested there, and on the 24th of May, as I was travelling
on the Torne River, I passed once more
the Arctic Circle. It was raining. I was told that
it was the first rain that had fallen for over seven
months.</p>

<p>Here I said good-bye to the good Mikel and
thanked him cordially for the care he had taken of
me.</p>

<p>I had now left the kingdom of the "Long Night,"
and the "Long Day" was to rule over the land
through which we have travelled together.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Young Folks, Friend Paul has come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
back, as you bade him, and I hope you have enjoyed
our travelling together in "The Land of the Long
Night." Good-bye. Do not forget your Friend
Paul, who loves you dearly, for once he was one of
the Young Folks himself.</p>

<p>"These luxuriously printed and profusely illustrated volumes embody
the fullest account of our Norse ancestors extant. Mr. Du

ground. This extensive and important work must be of high interest
to all English-speaking people."</p>

<p class="head1">London Athen&aelig;um.</p>

<p>"What is really valuable in these volumes is the exhaustive digest
which they contain of the extant information respecting the manners
and character of the ancient people of Scandinavia. The work deals
with the entire field of Scandinavian arch&aelig;ology. In the main, we
believe the picture he has drawn of the manner of life of the Vikings
and their countrymen to be as accurate as it is undoubtedly full of
interest."</p>


<p class="head1">Edinburgh Review.</p>

<p>"The subject of M. Du Chaillu's work is vast in extent and full of
perplexing difficulties. We have shown that its author has collected
a store of valuable information, a great part of which has hitherto been
inaccessible to English readers. His enthusiasm will have a very useful
effect if it leads the people of this country to study and admire the
ancient civilization and the splendid literature of our Scandinavian
kinsmen."</p>

full of interest."</p>

written upon the life of the ancient inhabitants of the North, no such
comprehensive, popular work as this, with citations from the old
literature and illustrations of all sorts of objects preserved from the
ancient days, has yet appeared. It is, accordingly, an unused opportunity
that the author of the work, with characteristic energy, has
recognized and seized. The two volumes are filled to overflowing
with curious and interesting facts concerning the people of the Scandinavian
North, whose manners, social customs, and national life the more
than thirteen hundred illustrations serve to bring up almost visibly
before us. The book as a whole is a record of persistent and ingenious
research, and of extraordinary literary zeal."</p>


<p class="head1">Philadelphia Record.</p>

<p>"M. Du Chaillu's book is full of valuable information respecting

<p>"Mr. Du Chaillu's monumental work, 'The Viking Age,' upon
which the careful labor of over eight years has been expended, is one
for which scholars will be profoundly grateful. It brings together
from innumerable sources a vast amount of information, relative to the
period covered, never before put in systematic form. The chapters on
the mythology and cosmogony of the Norsemen, on the superstitions,
slavery, graves, finds, weapons, occupations, feasts, warfare, etc., are
intensely interesting. The text is accompanied by nearly fourteen
hundred illustrations."</p>

<p>"'Ivar the Viking' is to be thoroughly recommended. The story
is characteristically spirited, and the romantic part leaves nothing to be
desired."</p>


<p class="head1">Chicago Tribune.</p>

<p>"It is full of vigor, and seems to bear internal evidence of truthfulness
as regards its historic side. Ivar was a Viking whose adventures
the juvenile reader, and particularly the boy juvenile, will follow with
eager interest."</p>


<p class="head1">Philadelphia Press.</p>

<p>"Of the subsequent adventures of Ivar and his foster-brothers the
interested reader must gain knowledge in the pages of the delightful
narrative itself. Suffice it to say that there is no lack of romantic
incident at any stage of the story. The prowess of the four Vikings
is always potent; they fall in love; Ivar fights a duel, and then wins
the loveliest of brides. There is throughout the volume the stimulating
air which blows through the Sagas, the nipping salt air of the sea."</p>


<p class="head1">Richard Henry Stoddard.</p>

<p>"There is that in Mr. Paul Du Chaillu's 'Ivar the Viking' which
not only satisfies the lover of romantic adventure, but carries the scholar
back into the remotest period of Scandinavian history. Beyond all
living writers this traveller in and explorer of many countries has collected
the documents and discovered the secrets of the Norselands."</p>


<p class="head1">New York Times.</p>

<p>"The reader who has begun with a blank mind closes the volume
with a tolerably clear impression of a very energetic, powerful, and
wealthy young Viking, capable of strong affections and disaffections,
foremost in games and fights requiring physical force, and with a vast
number of habits and customs. It is a history that interests through
its simplicity."</p>


<p class="head1">Boston Transcript.</p>

<p>"For the splendor of the materials and the range and variety of the
information imparted concerning the misty dawn of our Northern
civilization, its religious ideas, its moral conceptions, and its social
conditions, 'Ivar' will have high esteem among the growing number
of students turning to the Northern folk-lore and chronicles for the
true classic period of our modern races."</p>


<p class="head1">Philadelphia Public Ledger.</p>

<p>"He has rendered a double service, for not only does he instruct

a story of adventure and daring which will be followed with breathless
interest."</p>
